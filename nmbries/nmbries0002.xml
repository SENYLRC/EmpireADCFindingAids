        <arrangement>
            <p>Most of these boxes were processed during a previous attempt to organize the archives. It appears that boxes of file folders from scientists and staff who left the Cary Arboretum in the 1970s and 1980s were transferred to the archive with minimal processing.  Later boxes (90-103) were processed in 2003.</p>

            <p>In 1967, Mary Flagler Cary left her 2,000 acre Millbrook estate to a charitable organization â€œengaged in the conservation, maintenance, and preservation of natural resources".  In 1971, the Mary Flagler Charitable Trust accepted a proposal from the New York Botanical Garden to establish an arboretum devoted to research and educational activities.  The Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum opened to the public in 1977.  
</p>
            <p>In 1983 the Cary Arboretum became the Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES), and in 1990 the Institute became an independent, non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation.  The name of the Institute changed to Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in 2008.</p>
