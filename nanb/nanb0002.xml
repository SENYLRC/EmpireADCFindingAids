        <bioghist>
            <p>Edward Jackson Bartlett was born in Hartford, Connecticut on July 21st, 1915 to Dr. William Bradford Bartlett and Ruth Jackson. During his youth, Bartlett attended the Fenn School, Browne and Nicholas, and Governor Dummer Academy. Bartlett then attended Bowdoin College for the 1935-1936 academic year, where he became a member of the fraternity, Kappa Sigma. In fall of 1936, Bartlett enrolled at Bard College and graduated in 1940, earning a degree in theater. </p>
            <p>A veteran of World War II, Edward Jackson Bartlett enlisted in 101st United States Naval Construction Battalion in March 1943 and served until January 1946. During this time, he frequently corresponded with his parents through written letters while he was stationed at Port Hueneme in California and in Okinawa. Many of these letters show signs of censorship. After serving in the war, Bartlett resided in Concord, Massachusetts, as a furniture maker. Bartlett died at the age of 78, on July 18th, 1994 in Carlisle, Massachusetts.  His wife, Joan Motley, predeceased him in April, 1992.</p>
