            <abstract>This collection documents the life and activities of members of the Bard family over the course of five generations, beginning with Peter Bard (1679-1734), and ending with John Bard (1818-1899), who founded Bard College with his wife, Margaret Johnston Bard (1825-1875). Peter Bard came to the United States in 1706 and settled in Delaware. It was here that he met Dinah Marmion, who he married in 1709 and with whom he had eight children. The eldest son, John (1716-1799), married Susanne Valleau in 1737, and together they moved to Hyde Park, New York. John became a physician and together they had six children, the most notable of whom was Dr. Samuel Bard.  Samuel attended King’s college (later Columbia); was imprisoned in France during the Seven Years War; received medical training in Edinburgh; launched and served as the first president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York; and served as a professor and a Trustee of Columbia College. Samuel was a leader in American medical education. He wrote multiple medical books, and, though a Loyalist during the Revolution, served as George Washington’s personal physician. Samuel was not only a successful physician, he also accumulated large amounts of land in the Hyde Park, New York area, renting out parcels of land to tenants. He married his cousin, Mary Bard in 1770, and together they had eight children, three of whom survived to adulthood: Eliza Bard McVickar (1789-1838); William Bard (1778-1853); and Susannah Bard Johnston (1772-1845). Susannah was the eldest daughter of Samuel and Mary. In 1792, she married John Johnstone. Together, Susannah and John had twelve children. Their eldest son, Francis Upton Johnston (1796-1858) studied under his grandfather, Dr. Samuel Bard, attending the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and later was the attending physician at the New York Hospital. This collection contains correspondence documenting family matters, illness, local news, thoughts on religion and books, and academic and professional concerns. Materials also document the business and professional affairs of the family, including deeds of land, leases and indentures, three manuscript volumes containing the text of lectures on natural philosophy delivered by Samuel Bard to students at Columbia College. Also included are several portraits of family members, multiple wills, two framed copies of a genealogical chart, documents about the founding of St. Stephen's College in 1860, and a bound manuscript of family recipes titled "Receipt Book."</abstract>

        <bioghist>
            
        <p>Peter Bard was the first member of the Bard family in the United States. A Huguenot, Peter Bard was born in France in 1679, and was eventually forced to flee with his father due to religious persecution under Louis XIV. Arriving in the United States in 1706, he settled down in New Jersey, near Philadelphia, where he bought a large tract of land in the Burlington township in 1714. It was here that he met Dinah Marmion, who he married in 1709. Peter Bard would continue on to serve on the Colonial Council for New Jersey, become a Commanding Colonel of a foot regiment in 1722, and became a judge for the supreme court of New Jersey. Together, Peter and Dinah had eight children. </p>
            <p>The eldest son of Dinah and Peter, John, was born in 1716. John married Susanne Valleau in 1737, and together they moved to Hyde Park, New York. John became a physician, and even served as a family physician to George Washington when he was a General. As a physician, John recommended the purchase of Bedloe's Island (now the Statue of Liberty), as a quarantine site for the isolation of contagious diseases. He also served as the first President of the New York Medical Society. John and Susanne had six children. Their daughter Susanna married Nathaniel Pendelton, who was Alexander Hamilton’s second in the famous duel with Aaron Burr in 1804. Of their children, the most notable was Dr. Samuel Bard. </p>
            <p>Samuel was born in Philadelphia in 1742. A sickly child, he had to be removed from school when he was 14 years old. However, this did not stop him from pursuing higher education and he went on to attend King’s College. In 1761, Samuel left to go to England and spent time in London before moving on to study medicine in Edinburgh; but on the second of November, his ship was captured by the French, being thought to be British during the seven years war. Samuel was imprisoned in Bayonne Castle in the small town of St. Jean De Luz, France. Samuel quickly wrote to Benjamin Franklin, who then intervened on his behalf and Samuel was released from the French prison in April of 1762. Later that year, Samuel began college in Edinburgh, studying natural philosophy, anatomy, and chemistry. After graduating as a physician, Samuel returned to New York. In New York, Samuel launched and served as the first president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the first medical school in New York City. This medical school was attached to King’s College, later Columbia College. The College pf {physicians and Surgeons was the first medical school to grant the Doctor of Medicine degree in American. Here, he also served as a professor of the theory and practice of medicine, chemistry, natural philosophy, and astronomy. He also served as a Trustee of Columbia College from 1787 to 1804. Along with the college, Samuel founded New York Hospital in 1771.Samuel was not only a leader in American medical education, he also wrote multiple medical books, including one on Midwifery. He also served as George Washington’s personal physician. Samuel was not just a successful physician, he also accumulated large amounts of land in the Hyde Park, New York area, renting large amounts of the land out to tenants and experimenting with sheep farming. He married his cousin, Mary Bard in 1770, and had five children together.</p>
            <p>Susannah Bard was the eldest daughter of Samuel and Mary, born in 1772. In 1792, she married John Johnstone. John Johnstone was Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Dutchess County. Together, Susannah and John had twelve children. Susannah was a caring mother and a devoted Christian, often worrying about her children and protecting their souls through the church. Susannah and John often had money problems, and could only afford to send one child to college. They chose their eldest son, Francis Upton Johnston, born in 1796. Francis Upton studied under his grandfather, Samuel Bard, attending the College of Physicians and Surgeons. He graduated college in 1820, and by 1828, he was the attending physician at the New York Hospital. In 1822, he married Mary Williamson, and together they had nine children. </p>
            <p>William Bard, the youngest son of Samuel and Mary Bard was born in 1778. He attended Columbia college and graduated in 1798, later becoming a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. In 1802, he married Catharine Cruger and together they had fourteen children. Their son, John, born in 1819, was also a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. John married Maragaret Taylor Johnston in 1849, and together they had 4 children. John founded St. Stephen’s College in 1860, which would become Bard College in 1935. Margaret died in 1875, and John remarried in 1876 to Annie Belcher, with whom he had one child. </p>

        <bioghist>
            <p>Peter Bard was the first member of the Bard family in the United States. A Huguenot, Peter Bard was born in France in 1679, and was eventually forced to flee with his father due to religious persecution under Louis XIV. Arriving in the United States in 1706, he settled down in Delaware, near Philadelphia, where he bought a large tract of land in the Burlington township in 1714. It was here that he met Dinah Marmion, who he married in 1709. Peter Bard would continue on to serve on the Colonial Council for New Jersey, become a Commanding Colonel of a foot regiment in 1722, and became a judge for the supreme court of New Jersey. Together, Peter and Dinah had eight children. </p>
            <p>The eldest son of Dinah and Peter, John, was born in 1716. John married Susanne Velleau in 1737, and together they moved to Hyde Park, New York. John became a physician, and even served as a family physician to George Washington when he was a General. As a physician, John recommended the purchase of Bedloe's Island (now the Statue of Liberty), as a quarantine site for the isolation of contagious diseases. He also served as the first President of the New York Medical Society. John and Susanne had six children. Their daughter Susanna married Nathaniel Pendelton, who was Alexander Hamilton’s second in the famous duel with Aaron Burr in 1804. Of their children, the most notable of whom was Dr. Samuel Bard.</p>
            <p>Samuel was born in Philadelphia in 1742. A sickly child, he had to be removed from school when he was 14 years old. However, this did not stop him from pursuing higher education and he went on to attend King’s college. In 1761, Samuel left to go to England and spend time in London before moving on to study medicine in Edinburgh; but on the second of November, his ship was captured by the French, being thought to be British during the seven years war. Samuel was imprisoned in Bayonne Castle in the small town of St. Jean De Luz, France. Samuel quickly wrote to Benjamin Franklin, who then intervened on his behalf and Samuel was released from the French prison in April of 1762. Later that year, Samuel began college in Edinburgh, studying natural philosophy, anatomy, and chemistry. After graduating as a physician, Samuel returned to New York. In New York, Samuel launched and served as the first president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the first medical school in New York City. This medical school was attached to King’s College, later Columbia College. The College pf {physicians and Surgeons was the first medical school to grant the Doctor of Medicine degree in American. Here, he also served as a professor of the theory and practice of medicine, chemistry, natural philosophy, and astronomy. He also served as a Trustee of Columbia College from 1787 to 1804. Along with the college, Samuel founded New York Hospital in 1771.Samuel was not only a leader in American medical education, he also wrote multiple medical books, including one on Midwifery. He also served as George Washington’s personal physician. Samuel was not just a successful physician, he also accumulated large amounts of land in the Hyde Park, New York area, renting large amounts of the land out to tenants and experimenting with sheep farming. He married his cousin, Mary Bard in 1770, and had five children together. </p>
            <p>Susanah Bard was the eldest daughter of Samuel and Mary, born in 1772. In 1792, she married John Johnstone. John Johnstone was Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Dutchess County. Together, Susannah and John had twelve children. Susannah was a caring mother and a devoted christian, often worrying about her children and protecting their souls through the church. Susannah and John often had money problems, and could only afford to send one child to college. They chose their eldest son, Francis Upton Johnston, born in 1796. Francis Upton studied under his grandfather, Samuel Bard, attending the College of Physicians and Surgeons. He graduated college in 1820, and by 1828, he was the attending physician at the New York Hospital. In 1822, he married Mary Williamson, and together they had nine children.</p>
            <p>William Bard, the youngest son of Samuel and Mary Bard was born in 1778. He attended Columbia college and graduated in 1798, later becoming a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. In 1802, he married Catharine Cruger and together they had fourteen children. Their son, John, born in 1819, was also a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. John married Maragaret Taylor Johnston in 1849, and together they had 4 children. John founded St. Stephen’s College in 1860, which would become Bard College in 1935. Margaret died in 1875, and John remarried in 1876 to Annie Belcher, with whom he had one child. </p>

            <p>This collection documents the life and activities of members of the Bard family over the course of five generations. Members of this family were lawyers, physicians, landlords, homemakers, and were involved in a wide variety of local activities, as well as were familiar with many important people such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Alexander Hamilton. Correspondence often documents family matters, illness, local news, thoughts on religion and books, and academic and professional concerns. Of note, correspondence includes the courtship between Peter Bard and Dinah Marmion, 1707-1712; several letters from Samuel Bard to his parents during his imprisonment in France, 1761-1762; letters between and among Samuel, Peter, William, John Bard, Susannah Bard and Francis Upton Johnston, 1761-1830 concerning school, travel and family news; and a letter from Nathaniel Pendleton to William Bard describing his role in the Hamilton - Burr duel, 1804. </p>
            
        <p>Materials also document the business and professional affairs of the family. Specifically, there are many land deeds for Bard properties in New Jersey and Dutchess County, New York, as well as indentures and leases of the land. Pertaining to Samuel Bard, there are three manuscript volumes containing the text of lectures on natural philosophy delivered to students at Columbia College, ca. 1793. There is a manuscript volume of family recipes begun by Catherine Cruger Bard in 1803. The founding of St. Stephen's College in 1860 is documented in letters and scrapbooks. There are multiple wills of members of the family and a genealogy chart depicting the family tree.</p>
