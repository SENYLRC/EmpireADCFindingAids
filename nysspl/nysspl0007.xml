        <bioghist>
            <p>In 2005, George Neary and Helen Bayley filed a Freedom of Information application in order to obtain the records of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. At that time, the Executive Director, Herbert Chesbrough, had announced that the New York City Ballet would no longer call SPAC its summer home. Local citizens were incensed that the SPAC administration had made this announcement while also disclosing that the Center was no longer able to afford this type of programming. Several Board members quit, and the Executive Director, and his wife who was also on the payroll, were fired. The controversy over the Executive Directorâ€™s level of compensation lasted at least two years.</p>
