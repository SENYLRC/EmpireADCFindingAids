        <bioghist>
            <p>St. Faith’s School was founded in 1890 by Eleanor Shakelford as a school for low income girls. Within a couple of years, it had transformed to a boarding school for “girls of moderate means who look forward to being self-supporting”, according to the schools mission statement.

Marion Satchel (1905-1933) was born in Sidney, NY and attended St. Faith’s from 1919 to 1920. She later married Walter Coulter.

St. Faith’s closed its doors in 1951.

            <p>The single scrapbook was issued by St’ Faith’s so each girl could track her years at the school. The scrapbook has letters, notes, ephemera, photographs and clippings which chronicle Marion’s time there. In a pouch in the back of the scrapbook were a number of notes passed between Marion and her friends.</p>
