            <p>The Society of Women Geographers (SWG) Collection was donated to Buffalo State College by the estate of Dr. Katheryne T. Whittemore. Dr. Whittemore (1899-1981) was an instructor and administrator at the College for thirty-seven years, serving specifically as a professor of geography from 1925-1962 and having been appointed to the newly-created post of director of the Division of Arts and Sciences in 1957. She was an active member of the Society of Women Geographers as well as other influential organizations. The Society of Women Geographers began in 1925 as an organization that would bring together women of diverse intellectual backgrounds, enabling them to share knowledge gained from their experiences and fieldwork. As the SWG website says, "In naming [the] organization the Society of Woman Geographers, the founders took 'geographer' in its broadest sense to include such allied disciplines as anthropology, geology, biology, archaeology, oceanography, and ecology. Specialized aspects of the arts round[ed] out the broad spectrum of worldwide interests and professional activities of the Society's members." The Society of Women Geographers remains an active organization. More information on the Society can be found at http://www.iswg.org.</p>
