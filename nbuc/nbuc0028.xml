            <abstract>Dr. William H. Tallmadge (1916-2004), Professor of Music and charter member of the Sonneck Society (now the Society for American Music). Dr. Tallmadge taught music at Buffalo State College from 1949-1976, specializing in jazz and American folk music. Indeed, he developed the first course for credit in the United States on the history of jazz. Dr. Tallmadge's work is especially notable for the attention he paid to recording and studying African American church music of the early 20th century, though it is believed that none of these recordings are maintained within this collection. Dr. Tallmadge continued to teach at Berea College after his retirement from Buffalo State College.</abstract>

            <p>The William Tallmadge Music Collection is comprised mainly of commercial recordings and reel-to-reel tapes of music utilized in Dr. Tallmadge's music classes. Notably, many of the latter material has not be fully processed; consequently the exact titles of these records are unclear. Other materials include 1.5 linear feet of commercial music catalogues from the 1930s and 1940s as well as one linear foot of notes on index cards related to the collection's contents.</p>
