            <abstract>In 1913, a small group of members in the Association of College Alumnae (today known as the American Association of University Women) established the College Club. It was organized to promote the social and intellectual interests of college educated women in Buffalo and its vicinity and maintained a clubhouse for this purpose. In 1914, 172 members met and adopted a constitution naming the organization the College Club of Buffalo, Inc. The first clubhouse was a rental property on Park Street, Buffalo; and in 1915 the Club moved to its present location at 264 Summer Street, Buffalo, NY.</abstract>
