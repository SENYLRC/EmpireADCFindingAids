            <abstract>The collection contains not only the originals manuscripts, both longhand and typescript, of several of her books, but also, in many instances, includes her notes, original sketches, and correspondence showing the inception of ideas, it is extremely valuable as resource materials for in-depth studies of how a recognized author created the books which have won her the top awards in the field of children’s literature. By examining the notebooks and correspondence, students can become aware of Lenski’s methods of research in obtaining the materials she needed when writing her books. Lenski’s approach to environmental background of her regional stories, as illustrated in her correspondence with children and concerned adults, is a technique unique to Lenski, and one which should be of special value to individuals interested in the writing of regional realistic fiction. Numerous boxes and folders contain copies of her books, photos, manuscripts, notes, drawings, awards, and work of students whom inspired Lois Lenski to write and publish.</abstract>

            <p>In 1957, the well-known author-illustrator, Lois Lenski (1893-1974), presented a collection of her books, original illustrations, and manuscripts, as well as extensive files of research materials to the E. H. Butler Library of SUNY Buffalo State College. Lois Lenski was the author and illustrator of over 200 children’s books and winner of the coveted Newbery and Caldicutt award in children’s literature. She was best known for her hands on research in compiling her works.  Periodic generous gifts from Miss Lenski have considerably enlarged the initial collection, and it is considered one of the most complete collections in the country.</p>
