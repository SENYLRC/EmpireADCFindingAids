            <abstract>Microfilm copy was purchased from the Library of Congress' original Frederick Law Olmsted Papers in 1978. The papers of Frederick Law Olmsted housed in the Library of Congress were processed in 1963; additional material was processed and a revised edition of the register published in 1975. Items acquired by the Library of Congress after 1978 are not included in the microfilm reels, but are present in the inventory. The papers of Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903) span the years 1777 to 1952, with the bulk of the material dated 1838 to 1903. The papers document Olmsted's varied careers as farmer, journalist, editor, and landscape architect, as well as his private life. The collection consists of journals, correspondence, letterbooks, business papers, legal and financial papers, maps, drawings, reports, speeches, lectures, essays, articles, book manuscripts, scrapbooks, newspaper clippings, and miscellaneous items. Numerous family papers are also included.</abstract>
