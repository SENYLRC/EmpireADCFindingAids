            <p>Hank Nuwer, a 1968 graduate of Buffalo State College, is a social critic and author. Hank credits Buffalo State professors and students for contributing to his success as an author and journalist. In 1999, he wanted to give something to the college in honor of Professor Fraser Drew, who inspired him to write, and in honor of a fellow classmate, the late Joe Nikiel. Hank has authored more than 18 books, one of which, Broken Pledges, was made into a 1994 TV movie, "Moment of Truth: Broken Pledges." His research on binge drinking and hazing in schools and higher education has made him a sought after expert by CNN and other national television networks doing special reports on those topics.</p>
