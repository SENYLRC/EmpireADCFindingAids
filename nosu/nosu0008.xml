							<abstract>Professional collection of Dr. Harvey M. Rice, fifth President of SUNY Oswego from 1947 to 1952. In the postwar years, the administration of Harvey M. Rice kickstarted a period of ambitious yet sustained growth that also began to turn Oswego into a residential campus. Buildings opened during the Rice administration included our first residence halls (Lonis and Moreland) and student union (in what is now Mackin). Among other noteworthy accomplishments, under Riceâ€™s presidency, Oswego became a founding member of the SUNY system in 1948.</abstract>
