							<p>The Pennellville Diaries were written by Lulu S. Perry and possibly Frederick Thompson, both from Pennellville, New York. It is believed that the two were possible married
sometime after the Thompson Diary was written and were later found as a set. Pennellville is a rural farming community in the township of Schroepple, Oswego County, New York.</p>
