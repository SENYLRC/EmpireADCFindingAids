            <p>2015 program excerpt:  "In 1979 the Scholarly and Creative Activity Committee (SCAC), then known as the Faculty Research Committee (FRC), wanted to develope ways to encourage more research on campus.  On suggestion was to have a Scholarly Activities at Osego Conference Day, where faculty could present their research to the campus community.  FRC Chair Dr. Helen Daly organized the day, and it was decided to cal it Quest '80, in honor of the College's 'quest for knowledge.' </p>
            <p>After the second Quest day, the following year, the administration knew that Quest would be a successful annual program, and canceled classes for the first time for Quest '82, and this practice has continued ever since."</p>

                    <p>Panel:  Love, Sexual Desire, Happiness and Freedom in Plato, Quest 1987.       

The panel consists of three papers.  While all three address the concept of love in Plato and use Plato's Symposium and Phaedrus as their basic sources, each emphasizes a different aspect of this concept.  Because of their common ground and difference, the three papers together give a sense of both the depth and breadth of Plato's view of love, which in many respects does not resemble the views that have currency today and is, therefore, especially interesting.

The panel consists of three papers.  The paper by Ms. Ellis addresses the presentation of rape in literature and the ambiguity of its presentation.  The paper by Ms. Hopkins addresses pornography and the debate about its censorship and , the paper by Ms. Maltz in contrast to the other two papers, addresses the communication of love, whether verbally or physically.

                    <p>Paper:  Arnold, Kim--Gay Rights Movement, Quest 1987.    

The social movements of the 1960s and 1970s included the issues of civil rights, peace, women's liberation, and gay liberation.  This paper explores the problem of discrimination in employment of gays.  It was not until 1965 that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided that a person could not be disqualified for government employment because of charges of gay or lesbian behavior.  Testimony of C. Christensen, a dean and professor at Syracuse University Law School; J. O'Leary, President of the National Association of Business Councils; and Hon. P. Tsongas, will be examined, utilizing Rosenfield's theory of criticism.

                    <p>Paper:  Darling, Gary--McCarthyism:  The Movement and the Meaning, Quest 1987.       

McCarthyism was based on the amplification of fears of communism, based primarily on unfounded accusations of communists being in the U.S. government.  We could fall into a similar situation today.  We may even deny it is happening.  Finding a scapegoat and convicting a person or several people in a kangaroo court is pushing our own values aside.  This paper examines the role of the media and discourse of Senator McCarthy, President Truman, and Senator John C. Stennis, using Kenneth Burke's Theory of Movements.</p>

                    <p>Paper:  Marcy, Sue--War Is Not Healthy for Children and Other Living Things, Quest 1987.   

The Vietnam "conflict" was clouded by confusion.  Using Marie Rossenwasser's and Molefi Asanti's Movement theories, this study agreed with Nancy Zaroullis when she said in Who Spoke Up "...the anti-war movement during the Vietnam era is important not because it stopped the war which it may or may not have done; rather it was important because it existed.  It is a reminder to Americans that ... citizens can and indeed must challenge the government's authority."  The anti-war protests could be seen in correspondence, speeches and songs by Martin Luther King, Jr., Bell Abzug, folk singer, Phil Ochs, and parent, Frank H. Mentz.

                    <p>Paper:  Mercadante, Andrea--The German Underground Resistance to Hitler, Quest 1987.    

The German underground resistance movement to Hitler demonstrated great courage.  This paper will look at court testimony given by Rivka Yosselevska on May 8, 1961 from "Women in the Resistance and the Holocaust:  The Voices of Eyewitnesses".  Using Kenneth Burke's theory of the dramatic pentad, this discourse and others will be analyzed.  The German underground resistance to Hitler and the Nazis was a widespread devoted group of people along with many others who envisioned the end of the Third Reich.
