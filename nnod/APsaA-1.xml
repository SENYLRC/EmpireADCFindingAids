            <p>The American Psychoanalytic Association was founded in 1911 by Welsh neurologist and psychoanalyst Ernest Jones with the support of Sigmund Freud. Other founders of the organization were Adolf Meyer, James Jackson Putnam, G. Lane Taneyhill, John T. MacCurdy, Trigant Burrow, and G. Alexander Young. The APsaA is the second oldest psychoanalytic organization in America after the New York Psychoanalytic Society, which was founded a few months before by Abraham Arden Brill.</p>
