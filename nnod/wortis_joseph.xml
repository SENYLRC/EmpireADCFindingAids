						<bioghist>
							<p>Joseph Wortis was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 2, 1906, one of five children of a Russian watchmaker and a French Alsatian mother. He attended New York University, where he majored in English literature before switching to a pre-medical course and graduated in 1927. Soon after graduation, Wortis travelled to Europe. Instead of returning to the United States to attend Yale University Medical School in the fall, he spent the next five years studying medicine at the University of Vienna, Medical Faculty (1927-1932) and in Munich and Paris. Upon returning to the United States, Wortis became a resident in Psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital, where he remained for less than a year. Havelock Ellis, the famous writer and sexologist whom he had met while on summer vacation in England in 1927, wrote asking if Wortis would accept a generous fellowship to return to Europe to study problems in the area of homosexuality. Wortis accepted. Mrs. A. Kingsley Porter funded the fellowship. Broad in its mandate, the fellowship allowed Wortis to first develop his skills and training in psychiatry with the expectation that he would later turn his attention to sex research.</p>
            <p>Ellis and Adolph Meyer, then Chief of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University, became joint sponsors of the fellowship, which Wortis received from 1933 to 1940. The fellowship took Wortis through his studies in England and Vienna and through his residencies at New York University Medical College (1934-1938) and his teaching assistantship in Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School (1938-1939). In England, Wortis was at Maudsley and Queens Square Hospitals, London, and in Vienna, he was at Neurologic Institute under Otto Marburg.</p>
            <p>In 1934, Wortis married Helen Zunser, with whom he had been intermittently involved since his New York University days and who was the daughter of a prominent Jewish literary family. That same year, Wortis began his fellowship by returning to Vienna to undergo didactic psychoanalysis under Dr. Sigmund Freud. Freud analyzed Wortis over a period of four months (October 1933 to January 1934), which Wortis later described in Fragments of an Analysis with Freud. During the same year in Vienna, Wortis met Dr. Manfred Sakel and observed his new insulin shock treatment for schizophrenia. Wortis introduced the insulin treatment when he returned to America in 1935. Later her translated Dr. Sakel's German monograph on the treatment and helped bring Dr. Sakel to America. </p>
            <p>For several years thereafter, Wortis served as Research Fellow and later managed the treatment ward and research laboratory on brain metabolism at Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital, where he remained Clinical Professor of Psychiatry until 1953. From 1941 to 1943, Wortis worked at Columbia University as a Research Associate in Physiology and as a Physiological Investigator at the Aviation Research Laboratory. During World War II, he served as Chief Psychiatrist (Lieutenant Commander) at the New York Port Office of the War Shipping Administration (United States Public Health Service) and as a neuropsychiatrist at Ellis Island Marine Hospital (1943-1945).</p>
            <p>From the mid 1930s to the mid 1950s, Wortis became known for his physiological approaches to psychiatry. With a knowledge of six foreign languages, for many years he wrote an annual review of world literature describing physiological methods of treatment for the American Journal of Psychiatry. As a Socialist and Marxist, Wortis gave popular evening courses at the worker's Jefferson School in Manhattan (ca. 1942-1947) at the same time he led a small group of psychiatrists in founding the Benjamin Rush Society. At the close of World War II, Wortis became active in the newly formed American-Soviet Medical Society. Stuart Mudd, the Society's president, induced Wortis to prepare a comprehensive volume on Soviet psychiatry. His Soviet Psychiatry (1950) was a digest of Soviet psychiatric literature because the political climate at that time did not allow for visits to the Soviet Union. From 1946 until 1952, Wortis
served as Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Insulin Treatment Unit at New York University.</p>
            <p>In 1953, at the height of the McCarthy era, Senator Jenner's Congressional investigative committee summoned Wortis. The committee was set up ostensibly to investigate "Subversive Influence in the Educational Process." Repeatedly asked if he was a member of the Communist Party, Wortis defied the committee by refusing to answer any questions. However, the political harassment Wortis received both preceding and following the hearings, in his view, made it impossible for him to achieve high academic rank or to attract support for his hospital work or research. During this time, Wortis entered the field of mental retardation. He worked at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, where he served as Director of the Division of Pediatric Psychiatry from 1950 until 1967. While he was at the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn, Dr. Wortis established the Solomon Clinic for the Rehabilitation of Mentally Retarded Children.</p>
            <p>After a change of political climate in the late 1950's, Wortis began again to receive financial support. In particular, a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (1958-1964) for the translation of Russian psychiatric literature allowed him to travel to the Soviet Union (ca. 1958-1959). During this period, Wortis rose to prominence in the field of mental health. From 1960 until 1973, Wortis served as Professor of Psychiatry at SUNY Downstate Medical Center (Maimonides) and from 1973 through the 1980s, he served in a variety of research and teaching programs involving special education at SUNY Stony Brook. He also edited the Society of Biological Psychiatry's journal Biological Psychiatry from 1959 through 1992.</p>

							<p>The collection provides substantial documentation of Dr. Wortis' academic associations and activities; his writing and research; his theoretical contributions to the field of psychiatry; his relationships with notable scholars who influenced him; and his personal friendships, marriage, and hobbies and interests. To a lesser degree, records in the collection reflect his role as a teacher, lecturer, and practicing psychiatrist. There are few documents pertaining to his affiliations with the Communist party. The collection consists of taped interviews, manuscripts for books and articles, personal and professional correspondence, diaries, notebooks, photographs, newspaper clippings, transcripts and cassette tapes of interviews, and slides from lectures. Materials of particular interest include: published scientific writings and notes covering his career (Series 3: Writings); letters describing his courtship and marriage to Helen Zunser and his relationship with Gerda Vorster (in German) (Series 1: Correspondence); research notes and materials leading to the publication of Fragments of an Analysis with Freud, Soviet Psychiatry and Tricky Dick and His Pals (a children’s' book) (Series 3: Writings; Series 6: Other Biographical Materials - Reviews; Series 1: Correspondence); correspondence between Wortis and Havelock Ellis and between Wortis and Adolf Meyer (Series 1: Correspondence); correspondence and reports made by Wortis to Mrs. A. Kingsley Porter (fellowship provider, 1933-1940) (Series 1: Correspondence); editorials written for the Journal of Biological Psychiatry (Series 7: Professional Interests and Affiliations); writings composed while a student at New York University (1923-1927) (Series 3: Writings); drawings, sketches, essays, interviews and travel notes (Series 6: Other Biographical Materials); research notes and materials about Dr. Heinrich Hoffmann. (Series 7: Professional Interests and Affiliations); treatment records from Brooklyn Jewish Hospital (late 1950s) (Series 2: Study, Treatment and Research Materials).</p>
						<arrangement>
                <p>The collection has been arranged in eight series which have been further organized into subseries. Within series, the files are arranged alphabetically, chronologically, or by type of document. Whenever possible the file organization created by Dr. Wortis was preserved. This is true for Series 1: Subseries 4 (Administrative Correspondence) and Series 7: Subseries 3 (Editorship, Society of Biological Psychiatry). </p>

    <abstract>Folders in this series are arranged by type or topic of document in loose chronological order. The first 3.25 boxes contain patient information regarding individuals undergoing insulin shock therapy, Metrazol treatment, and electroshock therapy, including case records for Wortis’ work on homosexuality, schizophrenia, and the psychological conditions of seamen at the Ellis Island Marine Hospital (1943-1945). Included with these records are notebooks, charts, and other data, and any materials containing Protected Health Information are restricted by HIPAA. The remaining 2.75 boxes contain miscellaneous notebooks and research notebooks from Vienna (1928-1934) covering such medical topics as cardiac psychosis. There are also notes and data on alcoholism and brain metabolism research. When possible, materials covering common areas of study were placed together. See Oversize Box for graphs showing metabolic brain research on rats. </abstract>

    <abstract>This subseries contains several Wortis bibliographies and his manuscripts, notes, printed and published works, and miscellaneous. Manuscripts are organized alphabetically. When there was a series of manuscripts about a specific individual, the folders were placed together under the last name of the individual. For instance, all papers with Havelock Ellis in their titles are placed under “Ellis.” Housed with the manuscripts are often corresponding notes, letters, or other materials. If it was evident that a folder of notes (not in manuscript form) relates specifically to a manuscript (completed or in progress), the notes were housed with the manuscript. The next two boxes contain notes arranged by topic and notes difficult to identify. These files include Wortis’ notes describing his meetings with Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud, notes on mental retardation, and typed notes from his trip to Russia, 1959-1960. Printed writings, those which have been professionally printed or published, are located in the next three boxes. These works are arranged chronologically and also include editorials written for the Journal of Biological Psychiatry. Printed writings are followed by miscellaneous writings organized by document type, and consist of Wortis' letters to the editor, a folder of book reviews by Wortis, his translations of Dr. Manfred Sakel's monograph on insulin treatment, and various professional writings by Henry Wortis and Helen Zunser Wortis.</abstract>

    <abstract>This subseries contains several Wortis bibliographies and his manuscripts, notes, printed and published works, and miscellaneous. Manuscripts are organized alphabetically. When there was a series of manuscripts about a specific individual, the folders were placed together under the last name of the individual. For instance, all papers with Havelock Ellis in their titles are placed under “Ellis.” Housed with the manuscripts are often corresponding notes, letters, or other materials. If it was evident that a folder of notes (not in manuscript form) relates specifically to a manuscript (completed or in progress), the notes were housed with the manuscript. The next two boxes contain notes arranged by topic and notes difficult to identify. These files include Wortis’ notes describing his meetings with Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud, notes on mental retardation, and typed notes from his trip to Russia, 1959-1960. Printed writings, those which have been professionally printed or published, are located in the next three boxes. These works are arranged chronologically and also include editorials written for the Journal of Biological Psychiatry. Printed writings are followed by miscellaneous writings organized by document type, and consist of Wortis' letters to the editor, a folder of book reviews by Wortis, his translations of Dr. Manfred Sakel's monograph on insulin treatment, and various professional writings by Henry Wortis and Helen Zunser Wortis.</abstract>

    <abstract>This subseries contains several Wortis bibliographies and his manuscripts, notes, printed and published works, and miscellaneous. Manuscripts are organized alphabetically. When there was a series of manuscripts about a specific individual, the folders were placed together under the last name of the individual. For instance, all papers with Havelock Ellis in their titles are placed under “Ellis.” Housed with the manuscripts are often corresponding notes, letters, or other materials. If it was evident that a folder of notes (not in manuscript form) relates specifically to a manuscript (completed or in progress), the notes were housed with the manuscript. The next two boxes contain notes arranged by topic and notes difficult to identify. These files include Wortis’ notes describing his meetings with Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud, notes on mental retardation, and typed notes from his trip to Russia, 1959-1960. Printed writings, those which have been professionally printed or published, are located in the next three boxes. These works are arranged chronologically and also include editorials written for the Journal of Biological Psychiatry. Printed writings are followed by miscellaneous writings organized by document type, and consist of Wortis' letters to the editor, a folder of book reviews by Wortis, his translations of Dr. Manfred Sakel's monograph on insulin treatment, and various professional writings by Henry Wortis and Helen Zunser Wortis.</abstract>

    <abstract>This subseries contains several Wortis bibliographies and his manuscripts, notes, printed and published works, and miscellaneous. Manuscripts are organized alphabetically. When there was a series of manuscripts about a specific individual, the folders were placed together under the last name of the individual. For instance, all papers with Havelock Ellis in their titles are placed under “Ellis.” Housed with the manuscripts are often corresponding notes, letters, or other materials. If it was evident that a folder of notes (not in manuscript form) relates specifically to a manuscript (completed or in progress), the notes were housed with the manuscript. The next two boxes contain notes arranged by topic and notes difficult to identify. These files include Wortis’ notes describing his meetings with Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud, notes on mental retardation, and typed notes from his trip to Russia, 1959-1960. Printed writings, those which have been professionally printed or published, are located in the next three boxes. These works are arranged chronologically and also include editorials written for the Journal of Biological Psychiatry. Printed writings are followed by miscellaneous writings organized by document type, and consist of Wortis' letters to the editor, a folder of book reviews by Wortis, his translations of Dr. Manfred Sakel's monograph on insulin treatment, and various professional writings by Henry Wortis and Helen Zunser Wortis.</abstract>

    <abstract>Arrangement is generally alphabetical by type of document. This series includes biographical and related materials on individuals such as A. Kingsley Porter, Havelock Ellis, Ezra Pound, and the Wortis and Zunser families, followed by news clippings pertaining to individuals (e.g. David Arkin, Henry Cowell, Ezra Pound, etc.) or subjects (e.g. mental retardation, insulin treatment, etc.). Files containing certificates, awards, identification cards, passports, plaques, and meeting and concert programs are organized chronologically, followed by miscellaneous postcards and photographs. Shock therapy paraphernalia and two journals kept by Henry Sigerist have been placed in boxes for oversize materials.</abstract>

    <abstract>Eight folders containing personal and professional information about Dr. Heinrich Hoffmann compiled by Wortis, possibly for research for his children's book Tricky Dick. Dr. Heinrich Hoffman wrote and illustrated the book, Struwwelpeter or Slovenly Peter, in Germany in 1858. It became a popular children's book and Wortis used it as a model for his own children's book, Tricky Dick.</abstract>
