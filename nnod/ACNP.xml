							<p>The College was founded in 1961 as a professional society in brain, behavior, and psychopharmacology research. It is a non-profit, tax exempt, scientific professional organization whose members are drawn from the fields of psychiatry, psychology, pharmacology, neurophysiology, neurochemistry, biochemistry and internal medicine. Its members are selected for membership to ACNP by their peers, primarily on the basis of their original scholarly contributions to the field of neuropsychopharmacology, which involves the evaluation of the effects of synthetic compounds or natural products upon the brain and human behavior. </p>
            <p>The primary function of ACNP is to serve as a forum for the exchange of scientific information regarding the pharmacology, toxicology, and clinical application of neuropsychopharmacological agents. ACNP members have testified as expert witnesses in the trials of major cases, worked jointly with various administrative agencies and executive departments, and testified before Congress on numerous legal, ethical, and scientific issues relating to neuropsychopharmacology and national health policy. Many of the federal government’s expert advisors on the use of antipsychotic and neurological substances and their potential for abuse are members of the ACNP. The College has annual meetings and conducts study groups and plenary sessions in addition to publishing a bulletin quarterly. The ACNP bestows the Daniel Ebron award for outstanding research in the field.</p>
            <p>The officers of the College are the President, President-Elect, Vice-President, Secretary-Treasurer, Assistant Secretary-Treasurer, and a Council consisting of the above-named officers, including the last retired President and five other members. The Council transacts all business of the College, including the approval or disapproval of all recommendations of committees, and determines dues structure and adopts rules and regulations for the election of the various classes of membership. Among its responsibilities, the Council creates and directs standing committees and elects editors and committees on publications. In 2008, the College placed its archives at the Louise M. Darling Biomedical Library at UCLA.</p>

							<p>The collection primarily consists of printed or mimeographed material; very little original correspondence is included in these records. The collection is comprised of the constitution and by-laws, the minutes of the Council and business meetings that took place at the annual meetings, programs pertaining to the annual meetings, abstracts of papers, workshops and posters presented at the annual meetings, published bulletins, and membership directories. Also included are information letters sent by the Secretariat to the members. The collection has no series and needs to be reprocessed.</p>
