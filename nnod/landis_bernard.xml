						<bioghist>
							<p>Erich Fromm was born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1900. He was awarded his Ph.D. in 1922 from the University of Heidelberg and also studied at the University of Munich and at the Psychoanalytic Institute in Berlin. He taught in Germany and in Mexico, and in the United States at Bennington College, Michigan State University and New York University. He was a founder and trustee of the William Alanson White Institute.</p>
            <p>Fromm was a psychoanalyst and developed his own system of treatment which he called "humanistic psychoanalysis." Major intellectual influences on his life were the Talmud, Buddhism, Karl Marx, J. J. Bachofen on Mother right and symbolism, and Sigmund Freud. He attempted to construct a system of ethical values based on the knowledge of human behavior. Fromm wrote many books commenting on contemporary society, read by laymen and professionals alike, including on alienation. He was active in the peace movement of the 1960â€™s and in the humanist socialist movement. He died in 1980.</p>
            <p>In 1974 Dr. Bernard Landis organized a psychology course in Locarno, Switzerland and brought a class of twenty-two students from the Purchase Campus of the State University of New York to Switzerland, to co-teach with Erich Fromm an intensive three-week seminar on current trends in psychoanalysis.</p>
