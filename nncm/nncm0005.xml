            <p>He attended Yale University (B.A. 1917) and upon graduation, joined the United States Army,
serving as an artillery officer in France at the end of the First World War. In 1919, he was
discharged and entered Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons (M.D. 1923). In
addition to his medical degree, he also received a Master of Arts degree (1922) in physiology

1961). Before 1968, Bellevue Hospital’s First Medical Division was staffed by faculty from
Columbia University’s College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons. During this time, he collaborated with
André Cournand at Bellevue Hospital in the fields of pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Dickinson,
along with Cournand and German physician Werner Forssmann, received a Nobel Prize for
Physiology or Medicine in 1956 for “their discoveries concerning heart catheterization and
pathological changes in the circulatory system.”[1]</p>
            <p>Richards also served as Scientific Director (1937-1950), among other roles, to the Merck
Institute and edited the Merck Manual. The Merck Company Foundation endowed a
professorship in medicine in his honor at Columbia University in 1968.</p>

Respiratory Disease Association (1968), the Kober Medal from the Association of American
Physicians (1970), and the Diamond Jubilee Medal from Bellevue Hospital (1973).</p>
            <p>He retired from Presbyterian and Bellevue hospitals in 1961, serving as a medical consultant for
a number of years. He died in Lakeville, Connecticut on February 23, 1973 at the age of 77.</p>

                    <p>Correspondence; academic papers and talks in the form of manuscripts and reprints; notes,
drawings, reports, a photograph album and films document the life and career of Richards. Of
note are black and white photographs of Richards and colleagues housed in a custom-made
album presented to Richards by Merck &amp; Co; moving pictures depicting Richards and other
recipients honored at the Nobel Prize ceremony in Sweden in 1956.</p>
                    <p>The photograph album entitled, “Dickinson W. Richards, M.D. Merck Institute, 1937-1968,”
contains 22 black-and-white photographic prints mounted to leaves. Photos depict Richards and
colleagues, interiors and exteriors of Merck facilities, meetings, dinners, etc. The album has a maroon binding and is housed in a clamshell case.</p>

                    <p>Correspondence from Dickinson Richards to his family members, the bulk being letters addressed to his
mother, Sally Richards, living at 163 Irving Avenue South Orange, New Jersey; her summer
residence at Sunapee, New Hampshire; and her New York City residence at 43 East 72nd Street.
He also writes to his father, Dickinson W. Richard; his sisters Katherine, Josephine, and
Gertrude; and his brother Edward. Included are postcards, telegrams, and accompanying
photographs.</p>
                    <p>His letters offer details from his summer training at Tobyhanna [Pennsylvania] camp in the
Headquarters Company, 10th Field Artillery, National Guard, Connecticut—the training grounds
populated by Yale University students and faculty. His training continued in Company 11 at Fort
Myer, Virginia; and 1st Training Company at Fort Monroe, VA, with excursions to locales such
as Washington DC, Newport News and “surf bathing.” He was transferred on September 17,
1918 to Camp Eustis, Virginia, and then marched to the embarkation Camp Stuart, located in
Newport News, Virginia on September 27th before deployment, but departed from Hoboken, New
Jersey.</p>
                    <p>A letter to his mother (May 1, 1918) includes five black-and-white photograph portraits of
Dickinson’s friends posed in uniform, identified as Sutherland Dows, David Dows, Browne,
Parsons, and Griffith. Another photograph of his Fort Monroe’s quarters is found enclosed in a
letter to his mother (May 5, 1918). A letter to Dickinson (September 5, 1918) from friend “Ken,”
an officer in the American Expeditionary Forces stationed in France, includes Ken’s portrait in
uniform. A photograph of Dickinson in uniform—a duplicate from his identification card—is
enclosed with his letter to his mother (Nov 24, 1918) from Le Havre, France.</p>
                    <p>His letters continue after leaving Le Havre. He then served with the 49th Artillery Coast Artillery
Corps (C.A.C.) at La Tresne in Bordeaux and Poudrerie Barrack, Bessens. He returned to the
U.S. from Europe on March 13, 1919. His correspondence ends April 1, 1919.</p>
