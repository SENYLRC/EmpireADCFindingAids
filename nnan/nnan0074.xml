Lovejoy (1919-1997) of Riverside, Connecticut, was an expert on early American dimes, assembling a collection spanning from 1796 to the late 20th century and coauthoring the definitive reference book on the subject, Early United States Dimes, 1796-1837 (1984). He was elected a member of the American Numismatic Society in 1975, became a fellow in 1978, and in 1988 was elected to the Society’s governing council. Lovejoy was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, and was a graduate of the Hotchkiss School (1937) and Yale University (1941). He served in Normandy and Northern France during World War II and then went on to earn an LL.B. from Yale before joining the New York Law firm of Breed Abbott, where he became a partner in 1958. He retired in 1987.</p></bioghist><accessrestrict><head>Access</head><p>Collection open to all researchers.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Allen Lovejoy papers, 1952-1994, Archives, American Numismatic Society.</p></prefercite><userestrict><head>Restrictions</head><p>Copyright restrictions may apply.
