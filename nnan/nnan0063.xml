Contains letters (1943-1946) from coin dealers B. Max Mehl of Fort Worth, Texas, and T. (Thomas) L. Elder of Pleasantville, New York, and Greenville, South Carolina. Most of the correspondence with Elder has to do with the buying and selling of coins, though at times personal opinions and other issues are addressed. For example, Elder is outspoken about workers striking during the war, and a letter from November 27, 1945, is quite blunt about a disagreement with Holland regarding payment for a 1793 cent. Included also are original letters sent from Holland to Elder, which were possibly given back to Holland by Elder’s wife, Ruth. There are letters from Ruth (circa 1950s) addressed to both Holland and his wife, including one dated November 1, 1952, telling Holland that the remainder of her late husband’s collection are to be given to Holland in the event of her death in appreciation for his assistance selling Elder’s books, papers, curios, and other materials. There are also several letters from the coin dealer Ira Reed of Philadelphia. The card index to Holland’s coin collection gives dealer, condition, price, and includes other notes. Also present is a copy of the list of coins, with price, from the sale of Holland’s collection through Pennypacker Auctions on May 8, 1959.</p></scopecontent></archdesc></ead>
