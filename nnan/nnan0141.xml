The notes are signed “Gus” and the one to Paul refers to himself as “stick in the mud uncle.” Also includes a letter to Annette J. St. Gaudens (the form of the name used by her family) from Sylvia H. Wood in response to an inquiry about a medal Augustus Saint-Gaudens, her husband Louis’s brother, had executed for the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893. Wood suggests that since her version is a cast piece it would have “little value to the Numismatic Museum, as it was never issued.” Additionally, there are two pages of notes on the medals, one identifying the owners of the Columbian Exposition medal as Annette J. St. Gaudens and her son Paul St. Gaudens.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict><head>Access</head><p>Collection open to all researchers.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Augustus Saint-Gaudens notes of appreciation and related items, 1906, Archives, American Numismatic Society</p></prefercite><userestrict><head>Restrictions</head><p>Copyright restrictions may apply.
