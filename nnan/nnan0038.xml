Bullowa. Most letters have to do with gathering information relating to coins from the U.S. Treasury, the American Numismatic Society (ANS), Pioneer National Monument Association (Lexington, Kentucky), the Texas Memorial Museum (Austin), and other locations, but other topics are covered, including an incident involving counterfeit commemorative half dollars (1934). A notebook (1942-1946) containing materials relating to various numismatic groups includes the transcript of a radio interview conducted when he was a private in the U.S. Army (1942) and the text of a speech on his numismatic experiences overseas (1946). The collection also includes a copy of his birth certificate; a pamphlet on the dedication of Camp Bullowa in Stony Point, New York; a copy of Bullowa’s The Commemorative Coinage of the United States, 1892-1938 (1938); and The Lincolnian (1930), the yearbook of the Lincoln School of Columbia University’s Teachers College. Also present are certificates from Boy’s Town, Nebraska (1946), the American Numismatic Association (1940), the Royal Numismatic Society (1946), and the American Society of Technical Appraisers (1951). Later materials relate to the activities of Bullowa’s wife, Catherine, and include scrapbooks and other items from numismatic conferences (1970s), a notebook of clippings and other materials on counterfeit coins (1980s and 1990s), and certificates from the Professional Numismatics Guild (1956 and 1965) and the American Society of Appraisers (1966). The collection includes several objects, including David Bullowa’s U.S. Army uniform emblems, dog tags, a device for embossing his name on documents, and medals and a pin from the American Numismatic Association.</p></scopecontent></archdesc></ead>
