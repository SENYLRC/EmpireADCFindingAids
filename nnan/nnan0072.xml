Levick was originally from Philadelphia and a member of that city's and the nation's first numismatic club — the Philadelphia Numismatic Society. Levick served briefly in the U.S. Army during the Civil War, eventually rising to the rank of captain. By 1864, Levick had moved to New York City, where he worked as a banker. That same year, Levick helped to form the New York Numismatic Society. Within a year, however, that organization merged with the American Numismatic Society to form the American Numismatic and Archeological Society. Levick continued as a member of the combined organization. In March 1866 he proposed the first numismatic journal in the United States — the American Journal of Numismatics — and served as its first editor. Publication of the AJN began in May 1866. In addition, Levick also served the ANS as its treasurer, a position he held from 1867 to 1875. Levick sold his collection of tokens, which included more than 20,000 pieces, in 1884. He died on September 7, 1908.</p></bioghist><accessrestrict><head>Access</head><p>Collection open to all researchers.</p></accessrestrict><prefercite><head>Preferred Citation</head><p>Joseph N.T.
