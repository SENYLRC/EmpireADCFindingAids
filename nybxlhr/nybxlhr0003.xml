            <abstract>Approximately 500 unique used and unused picture postcards depicting Bronxville scenes, primarily view cards of houses and other structures and some streetscapes and miscellaneous subjects. The collection includes at least one private mailing card, some two dozen undivided-back cards dating from 1906-07, and about three dozen real photograph cards. Many of the early cards were published by three Bronxville businesses: Chambers Pharmacy, Frederick S. Steinmanâ€™s Pharmacy, and stationer Thomas J. Lydon. At least 30 other publishers produced Bronxville cards over the years. The collection contains duplicates of many cards, many of which contain a variety of handwritten messages and postal cancellations.</abstract>

                <extent>Approximately 500 unique post card images. With duplicates the collection is approximately two linear feet contained in two standard size postcard boxes.</extent>
