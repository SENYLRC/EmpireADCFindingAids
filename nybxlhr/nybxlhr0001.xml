            <p>The collection brings together business records of William Van Duzer Lawrence, records of several of his family businesses, and family photographs taken probably by one of his daughters.</p>

            <p>The collection has four series.  The Accounts Ledger File includes ledgers kept by William Van Duzer Lawrence and others from 1888 to 1927.  The first three ledgers in the series seem to be entirely Lawrence's work, the fourth ledger appears to have been kept partly by him, and the remaining ledgers seem to have been kept by a number of people, including William Van Duzer Lawrence.  The Correspondence File includes two bound volumes of carbon copies of outgoing correspondence1916-1918, relating to Lawrence family business and signed primarily by William Van Duzer Lawrence and his two sons, Arthur W. Lawrence and Dudley P. Lawrence.  The Subject File, 1898-1985 contains documentation relating primarily to the many Lawrence family businesses from the 1910s through the 1960s.  The Property Records File, 1896-1977, contains indentures, deeds, mortgage related documents, and contracts relating to properties owned by the Lawrence family.  </p>
