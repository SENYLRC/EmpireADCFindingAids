            <p>The collection is in two series.  The Smith College Relief Unit File includes, most importantly, letters and reports by Hannah Dunlop Andrews relating to the work of the relief unit; two articles from April and July, 1918, about the relief unit which compile letters and reports by relief unit members; and a long pamphlet published in 1968.  Andrews’ letters give an account of her experiences in the war zone of France that is often wonderfully detailed and evocative of the particular violence of World War I.  Her letters also depict a small community of Bronxville residents brought together by experiences of war and concern for friends and loved ones engaged with war.  Andrews’ correspondence include Helen R. Thayer, the chairman of the Smith College Relief Unit Committee; Margaret Chambers Halsey and her parents Frank Ross Chambers and Kate Chambers; her brother, John Dunlop, and her mother-in-law, “Mother Andrews”; and a donor to the relief unit, a Mrs. Rouer (spelling uncertain).
	The Subject File includes a series of letters written by Captain/Major Charles W. Halsey to his wife Margaret Chambers Halsey, recounting his wartime experiences as a member of the quartermaster corps, American Expeditionary Force, 1917-1918; and a collection of research materials about Hannah Dunlop (Andrews) Colt created by former Bronxville village historian Eloise L. Morgan in about 1992.
	Both series include documents copies from Ms. Morgan from the Smith College Archives, and the Subject File also includes documents copied from the records of Sarah Lawrence College.
