Sorosis was founded in 1868 as a club organized and run by women, founded by Jane Cunningham Croly or “Jennie June” as she was more fondly known.   Croly’s organization of a convention composed of women’s clubs from around the country led to the formation of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs.  The ratification convention in 1890, held one year after its initial meeting in 1889, brought the organization to national prominence.     </p><p>Four years later, under Mrs. Fannie I. Helmuth’s leadership and 125 delegates, the New York State Federation of Women’s Clubs was formed.  Jane Cunningham Croly was promptly elected as its first president.  The club incorporated in 1904.  </p><p>As outlined in the certificate of incorporation, the objective of the organization was to, “bring into relationship of mutual helpfulness the various clubs of women throughout the state and to make combined action possible when deemed expedient. (Subgroup III: 1:1:2).”  The favorable response to the mission of the Club spurned a rapid growth in membership, by the second annual convention in 1896, 186 clubs within the state were represented.  </p><p>Education, industrial conditions, forestry, welfare work, prison reform, philanthropy, household economics and club ethics were major initiatives of the Club in the first decades of the 20th Century.  By the start of World War I the Club had expanded to 461 clubs and 300,000 federated women.  </p><p>During the presidency of Miss Mary Garrett Hay, 1910-1912, the rapid cultural shift could be evidenced in the club’s committee structure.  The reports of the Suffrage and the Anti-Suffrage Committees exemplify the differing views of the role of women during a swiftly evolving time (Subgroup I: 8:1:1-2).    </p><p>The N.Y.S.F.W.C. shifted focus to prohibition, environmental conservation and education in the 20’s and 30’s and had an increased presence during World War II, amassing bond sales to purchase an Army Bomber and ambulance, providing training for nurses and collecting books and Bibles for men in service.  </p><p>In 1951 the G.F.W.C. made it mandatory for all Club members to become paying members of the G.F.W.C.  The qualifications for G.F.W.C. and the financial obligations of membership reduced the membership of the N.Y.S.F.W.C.  </p><p>In 1970, the Federation changed from a membership corporation to a Not-For-Profit Corporation and in July of 1978 the change in designation was adopted.  Community programs, child welfare, foreign aid, prison reform, education and volunteerism were platforms for the organization over the next half century.</p><p>In 1994 the club celebrated its 100th Anniversary.  The emphasis on volunteerism and community involvement has shaped the efforts of the organization into the 21st Century. </p></bioghist><controlaccess><corpname source="lcnaf" authfilenumber="no2011008018">New York State Federation of Women's Clubs</corpname><corpname>General Federation of Women’s Clubs</corpname><subject>Women—Societies and Clubs—New York (State)</subject><subject>History—New York (State)</subject><subject>Women volunteers in Social Service—New York (State)</subject><subject>Civic improvement—New York (State)</subject><subject>Women’s rights—New York (State)</subject><genreform>Business Correspondence</genreform><genreform authfilenumber="300048730" source="aat">personal correspondence</genreform><genreform>Minutes (Records)</genreform><genreform authfilenumber="300026234" source="aat">directories</genreform><genreform authfilenumber="300026652" source="aat">newsletters</genreform><genreform authfilenumber="300027240" source="aat">programs (documents)</genreform><genreform authfilenumber="300026657" source="aat">periodicals</genreform><genreform authfilenumber="300026646" source="aat">yearbooks</genreform></controlaccess><scopecontent><p>The records of the New York State Federation of Women’s Clubs are primarily papers concentrated on the tenure of each elected president of the organization, documenting the presidents and the history of the organization for over a century, 1898 – current.
