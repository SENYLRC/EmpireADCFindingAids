The bulk of the letters are correspondence between Mary Gray Peck and her mother, Mary Diantha Gray Peck as well as letters from her father, Henry Jones Peck.  The bulk of Mary Gray Peck’s letters were written while a student and depict the academic rigor and social life at Elmira Female College in Elmira, N.Y. and are followed by letters from her time in New York City and Minnesota, while teaching and studying at the University of Minnesota.     Letters from Mary’s two brothers, James and Fred, including her sister-in-laws, are also represented in the collection.  A number of the photographs were taken on the family farm in Phelps, N.Y.  All members of the immediate family of Henry and Mary Diantha are in the collection, including a number of professional photographs of Mary Gray Peck and her friend and fellow suffragist, Frances Squire Potter.  
The papers document the history of a well-educated family from upstate New York in the late 19th Century and early 20th Century.  Letters concerning the professional activities of the Peck children, including Mary Gray Peck’s involvement in the suffrage movement, though present, are at a minimum.
