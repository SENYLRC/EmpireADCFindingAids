</p></accessrestrict><bioghist><p>The Sisters of St. Francis of the Neumann Communities is a catholic women religious congregation formed between 2004 and 2007 from the consolidation of the following New York and Pennsylvania Franciscan communities: Sisters of St. Francis of the Immaculate Virgin Hastings-on-Hudson N.Y; Sisters of the Third Order Regular Buffalo, N.Y.; and Sisters of St. Francis Pittsburgh, Pa.
</p><p>The primary objective of the order is to sustain the Gospel life of its members and support them while they engage in ministries throughout the world in education, health and social services. The order is known most for providing health care and education for those with Hansenâ€™s disease in Hawaii, and Saint Marianne Cope.
</p><p>Sisters live in groups in houses located near the education, health or social services ministry that they are engaged in. The leadership of the order require these sisters to annually submit a chronicle of their lives in the house, known as house histories.  They provide insight into sisters living in common and complete the historical narrative of the Sisters of St. Francis of the Neumann Communities. Historical sketches of missions, photographs, clippings, and house inventories are often submitted along with annual house histories. They are included in this collection.
