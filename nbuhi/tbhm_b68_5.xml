            <p>The Buffalo Choral Club was a women’s singing society founded and organized by
a group of prominent Buffalo musicians in April 1921. Ada M. Gates was its first president, and William Benbow was engaged as the group’s first Musical Director. The Club had twenty-two original members, but by the end of the first year had grown to include 80 singing members and more than 300 Associates.
Rehearsals were originally held at the old Iroquois Hotel, but later they were moved to the Y.W.C.A. building at West Mohawk Street (and its later quarters at 190 Franklin Street) The Club first established a pattern of giving two formal concerts each year, featuring well-known guest artists, but later just one annual concert was held, in the
spring.
The end of the Buffalo Choral Club is described by Club Historian Margaret Cartwright this way: “In the early spring of 1964 it was quite evident to the members of the Board that Buffalo Choral Club had reached the point where it did not fit into the busy, fast-moving pace of these times. After many hours of serious discussions, the decision was made to disband the organization.”</p>
