        <bioghist>
            <p>Charles Morgan Olmsted was born in Le Roy, N.Y., on January 19, 1881, the son of
John B. Olmsted (a former Public Service Commissioner) and Clara Morgan Olmsted. He attended Old Central High
School in Buffalo and later Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H. in preparation for his enrollment at Harvard.
From Harvard he received the Bachelor’s degree in 1903 and the M.A. in 1904. He attended the University of
Göttingen for a while before earning his Ph.D. degree in astrophysics from the University of Bonn in 1906.
From 1906 to 1909 Olmsted was a research assistant at the Mt. Wilson Observatory in California, where he did
research in astrophysics and spectroscopics, prepared several scientific papers for publication, and earned notoriety
within the scientific community for his discovery of the compound Calcium Hydride in the sun.
Olmsted returned to Buffalo in 1910 and founded C.M.O. Physical Laboratory, Inc., located at Fourth and
Carolina Sts. There he was engaged in aerodynamic research, designing airplane propellers and other airplane parts.
Samples of his propeller and other aerodynamic developments have been on display at the Smithsonian Institution.
During World War I, Dr. Olmsted served as a consultant to the Naval Advisory Board. Olmsted’s propellers were
built for the first Navy airplanes to fly the Atlantic. In 1910 he designed a monoplane with two original features:
retractable landing gear and laminated wood construction for the wings. This monoplane was exhibited at the Le Roy
Historical Society.
From 1932 to 1935 Olmsted was a research associate at the University of Buffalo, where he also served as
President of the Physical Science Club. In 1937 Charles M. Olmsted was appointed district supervisor of the W.P.A.
Federal Writers’ Project.
Olmsted also owned office buildings and other properties in downtown Buffalo, including the Franklin-Huron
Building and other buildings along Huron Street.
With his wife, Elizabeth Hamlin Macniel Olmsted, Charles Olmsted had the following children:
Dugald Macniel (b. ca. 1904); John Bartow, 2nd (b. 1905); Elizabeth A. (b. 1910; later Mrs. Preston Smith Jr.);
Charlice (Chassie) (b. ca. 1912; later Mrs. Gilbert Sayward); Huntington (b. ca. 1916). The three Sons attended
Harvard University; the two daughters attended Smith College.</p>
