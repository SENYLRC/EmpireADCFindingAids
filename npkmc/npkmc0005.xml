            <p>"The Clove Spring Iron Works was a company founded in the late 1800s in Dutchess County, New York. The general manager of the company was John S. Schultze, who oversaw smaller companies that ran under the authority of the Clove Spring Iron Works including Sylvan Lake, the Clove Branch Railroad, and Newburgh, Dutchess, and Connecticut Railroad Company. 

The Clove Spring Iron Works was also managed by members of the Brown Family: George Brown (President) and Sam Brown (Treasurer). Other employees include William Reid (Secretary/Treasurer), Charles A. Taylor (Cashier), and H.B. Willits, an assistant to Schultze. The company also conducted its operations--mainly its orders--through the company store. Crocker Brothers, a manufacturing company, frequently ordered materials from Clove Spring Iron Works to produce metals. 

The Sylvan Lake mines were where the company extracted coal and ore which were used to manufacture iron products. Important employees at Sylvan Lake were Normal J Plass and C.A. Stephens who both served as treasurer, and E.W. Plass and Oliver Davidson who were both agents. Oliver Davidson also managed the East Fishkill Mills with Silvanus Davidson. 
 
The company transported coal and iron materials by the Newburgh, Dutchess, and Connecticut Railroad Company, which John S. Schultze managed until John Crosby Brown became the President in 1902. William Wells served as secretary/treasurer until H.H. Reed became the treasurer in 1902.The Newburgh, Dutchess and Connecticut Railroad Company worked with the president of the Philadelphia Reading and New England Railroad Company, John Brock, to transport to materials outside of the tri-state area."
