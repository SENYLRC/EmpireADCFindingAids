            <abstract>In September 1962, the Consolidated Edison Company announced plans to build a pumped storage facility, the largest of its kind in the world, at Storm King Mountain near Cornwall, New York. The initial application for license to construct the plant was filed with the Federal Power Commission in January 1963. On November 8, 1963, a small group of concerned citizens met at the home of Carl Carmer and formed the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference to fight the pumped storage project on the grounds that it posed a threat to the Cornwall water supply and Hudson River fisheries as well as to scenic and historic Storm King Mountain.

Alexander Saunders, of Philipstown, New York, joined the fight against the Consolidated Edison Co. and was an active member of Scenic Hudson’s executive committee. In his testimony before the F.P.C. Mr. Saunders stated the mission and motivating factors that lead him, and many others, to become a part of Scenic Hudson, “When we began, there were not many of us. Today our membership exceeds 1,200. This is no special group. We are not simply the affluent. Our membership is from all walks of life and now from all parts of the country. There are many, I dare say, who have not even seen Storm King Mountain…Why then, some may ask, are we here? Your honor, we are here because we love the Hudson. We love this wonderful River and its wonderful hills… We hope that the children of the country will have a chance for that same affection.” (From Alexander Saunders, in testimony before the Federal Power Commission, Series 8, Box 75, Folder, 945, in the Scenic Hudson Collection, Archives and Special Collections, James A. Cannavino Library, Marist College).

Working closely with the other members of the organization, as well as the outside community, Mr. Saunders and Scenic Hudson were successful in their attempt to keep the pumped-storage facility from being placed on historic Storm King Mountain, thereby fulfilling his goal of ensuring that the children of the country would have a chance for the same affection he had toward the river.

The Storm King case lasted for 17 years. In a negotiated settlement in December 1980, Consolidated Edison agreed to drop the plan for the Storm King facility.

The lengthy and controversial case set important precedents in environmental law and is generally credited with spawning the modern environmental movement. Scenic Hudson, Inc. continues to serve as an environmental watchdog in the Hudson Valley.</abstract>
