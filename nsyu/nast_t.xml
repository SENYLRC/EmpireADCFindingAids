      <p>Thomas Nast (1840-1902) was an American cartoonist and illustrator. Nast is one the founding figures of American political cartooning. He published thousands of cartoons over the course of his prolific career and is credited with giving definitive form to many now commonplace icons like the Democratic donkey, the Republican elephant, Uncle Sam, and even the familiar version of the "American" Santa Claus. </p><p>Born in Landau, Germany, Nast was six years old when his family immigrated to America. Growing up in New York City, Nast studied art in his early teens with the painter Theodore Kaufmann and began his professional career at the age of 15 with <emph render="italic">Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</emph> (1855). In 1862, Nast became a staff artist for <emph render="italic">Harper's Weekly</emph>, and it was the work he did for this paper during the Civil War and after that most defined his reputation.  In the 1870s, Nast carried on his famous campaign against William Marcy "Boss" Tweed  and the corrupt group of New York City politicians associated with Tammany Hall. His Tammany tiger and Boss Tweed caricatures had a powerful resonance with the public and quickly became part of the vernacular of American political cartooning. </p><p>Nast's career with <emph render="italic">Harper's Weekly</emph> lasted for twenty-five years, ending in 1887. Subsequently, Nast continued to publish work on a freelance basis in publications like <emph render="italic">America</emph> and <emph render="italic">Once a Week</emph> (now <emph render="italic">Collier's Weekly</emph>), and for a short period was affiliated with the <emph render="italic">Illustrated American</emph> (1891). In 1892, Nast signed-on with the <emph render="italic">New York Gazette</emph> and soon took over the enterprise, changing the name of the paper to <emph render="italic">Nast's Weekly</emph>. The paper was short lived, however, and ceased publication the following year. The failure of <emph render="italic">Nast's Weekly</emph> and other troubled investments made Thomas Nast's last years financially very difficult. He lived in semi-retirement, taking painting commissions in Europe and sending occasional cartoons for publication. Very often during these years, friends and family would receive small cartoons from Nast, in lieu of written correspondence. In 1902, Nast received a diplomatic appointment from the Theodore Roosevelt administration to serve as Consul General in Guyaquil, Ecuador. Nast accepted the post and left for Ecuador in June of that year. Shortly after arriving in Ecuador, Nast contracted yellow fever and died after a protracted illness on December 7, 1902.</p></bioghist>
