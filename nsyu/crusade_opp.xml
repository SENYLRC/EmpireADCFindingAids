      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>The Crusade for Opportunity was an anti-poverty agency in Syracuse, NY that was founded in
            1964. Its goal was to reduce the rates of poverty, especially among poor minority
            communities. </p>
      <p>In the early 1960s, Syracuse, like the majority of other cities in America, had a
            struggling African American community. Still recovering from centuries of slavery and
            then racial prejudice and discrimination, black citizens suffered from housing,
            education, and employment disparities.</p>
      <p>In terms of housing, urban renewal programs and the placement of the I-81 highway in the
            heart of the city displaced 80 percent of Syracuse's black citizens. These two
            initiatives demolished the 15th ward, once a proud black community. After displacement,
            public housing decisions segregated blacks from whites. Black families who could afford
            to move out of public housing often faced racist landlords and home sellers who refused
            to sell or rent to black home-seekers. This not only created segregated neighborhoods,
            but also segregated schools. De facto segregation, where segregation is not established
            by law but how communities are formed and subtly enforced, was often difficult to
            combat. Attempts to bus black students to white, more affluent schools faced protests
            from both blacks and whites: black parents felt it was unfair that their children had to
            be bused to a new school district far from their homes; white parents were concerned
            about their children being forced to learn with black children. Schools with a high
            percentage of black students were underfunded, and black students had limited access to
            the same supplies (books, for example) that white students enjoyed. Consequently, high
            school dropout rates amongst the black communities were disproportionally high compared
            to white communities. The lack of education had far reaching effects: unemployment for
            African Americans, particularly youth, was enormously high. Yet, even educational
            success did not always guarantee a good job: qualified black job applicants frequently
            faced discrimination when they applied for professional positions.</p>
      <p>On the federal level, the Johnson Administration began its War on Poverty as a solution
            to this national crisis. This so-called "war" found its ammunition with The Economic
            Opportunity Act of 1964, which funded Community Action Programs (CAP) that helped poor
            communities rise out of poverty. These CAPs received federal funds from the Office of
            Economic Opportunity (OEO) but were operated by local government officials and the poor
            black communities they represented. Calling for "maximum feasible participation of the
            poor," at least 1/3 of a CAP's operating board were supposed to be the black citizens
            that the programs were representing.</p>
      <p>One of the first to receive federal money was the Community Action Training Center
            (CATC) in Syracuse, NY. The CATC was founded and operated by faculty and students from
            University College of Syracuse University. Under the direction of Dr. Warren Haggstrom,
            SU students from the CATC, sometimes labeled as "soldiers" in the War on Poverty, worked
            directly with the local black community. The CATC, however, clashed with city
            government, and when the mayor placed pressure on the OEO and the University, CATC lost
            their funding after only a year. </p>
      <p>When the CATC lost its funding, the Crusade for Opportunity (CFO) became Syracuse's
            premier anti-poverty agency operating under the model of maximum participation of the
            poor. Crusade for Opportunity was originally founded as the Mayor's Commission for Youth
            (CFY). The CFY was formed in 1962 under President Kennedy's President's Committee on
            Juvenile Delinquency. The CFY was one of a handful of city organizations chosen for this
            pilot program, and was created to study the underlying reasons for juvenile delinquency.
            Project planning operations were delegated to the United Community Chest and Council of
            Onondaga County, and research operations were performed by Syracuse University-based
            Youth Development. The research culminated with a report and proposal, "Syracuse Action
            for Youth," which was one of six proposals that were approved by the President's
            Committee on Juvenile Delinquency. Syracuse's proposal emphasized that the main cause of
            juvenile delinquency was the lack of economic opportunity. The report also suggested
            that in order for the poor to become agents of change they needed to have direct
            involvement in decision making. In June of 1964, Robert Kennedy visited Syracuse to
            announce that the Mayor's Commission for Youth had been awarded a grant to place the
            proposal in action, resulting in national attention to Syracuse and the CFO. Shortly
            after the publication of the report and proposal, it was rolled out on national scale
            and formed the basis for the Community Action Programs instituted in cities and rural
            areas across the nation. The organization changed their name to Crusade for Opportunity
            in the summer of 1964. </p>
      <p>Following the guidelines developed from their research, the CFO had a three-pronged
            approach to creating opportunity: better education, employment training, and community
            service. Education programs assisted poor students at all grade levels, from Head Start
            for preschoolers to learning assistance for struggling high school students. Employment
            programs ranged from youth job programs to on-the-job skill training. Finally, CFO
            created neighborhood centers around the city of Syracuse that offered a range of
            services to neighborhood teens and adults.</p>
      <p>Adhering to the "maximum feasible participation of the poor" mandate, the CFO
            established neighborhood boards that were manned and elected by the communities they
            served. The CFO's Board of Directors was drawn from these neighborhood board members.
            The more involvement CFO elicited from the poor, mostly black, community, however, the
            more the local power structure felt like they were losing control of decision making.
            The traditional power structure, where city officials design and pass policies and
            legislation, was being thwarted by these community board members. One scholar wrote that
            the CFO "began as a mainly all white establishment representing city hall and ended as a
            mainly black organization representing neighborhood residents." This shift of power
            raised racial tensions, as well as concerns that the organization was mismanaging funds,
            and the OEO cut CFO's funding at the end of 1967 causing the organization to cease
            operations. </p>
