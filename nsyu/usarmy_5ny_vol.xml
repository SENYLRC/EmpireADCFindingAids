      <p>The 5th New York Volunteers was a regiment of the Union Army raised in the spring of 1861 in response to President Lincoln's calls in April and May for volunteers to put down the rebellious Southern states.    One of the most decorated and respected units of the American Civil War, they were known as "Duryée's Zouaves" for their first commander, Colonel Abram Duryée, and their distinctive uniforms.    The regiment served as infantry and heavy artillery and were known for their effectiveness in combat and steadiness under fire; nine of its soldiers attained the rank of general.</p><p>Company F, formed of men from the New York City area, saw combat in Virginia at the battles of Gaines Mills, Manassas Junction (Second Bull Run), and  Fredericksburg in 1862 and at Chancellorsville in 1863.</p><p>[Portions of this biographical sketch adapted from the website of the Fifth New York Volunteer Infantry at <extref href="http://www.zouave.org/">http://www.zouave.org</extref>, and from information available on the website of the <extref href="http://www.dmna.state.ny.us/historic/reghist/civil/artillery/5thArtHvy/5thArtHvyMain.htm">New York State Military Museum and Veteran's Research Center</extref>.]</p>

The first volume, "Company Descriptive Book," dates from April 1861 to September 1862 and includes lists of officers, registers of men transferred and discharged, and registers of deaths and desertions.  The largest part of the book is a descriptive roll of the company, which gives each man's name, physical description, place of birth, and occupation.  Company F included a number of European immigrants and its membership worked at a wide variety of occupations.  The roll included a butcher, a sailor, a student, a carpenter, a lawyer, a teamster, and many others.</p><p>The second volume, "Company Morning Reports," covers May 1861 to April 1863 and includes a monthly account of the number of men present and absent as well as a "Remarks" section for each month.  There is mention of the company's participation in the battles of Gaines Mills (Virginia) on June 17, 1862, and in the Battle of Manassas Junction (Second Bull Run) on August 30 of the same year, in which the company sustained heavy losses.</p>
