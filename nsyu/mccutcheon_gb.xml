      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>George Barr McCutcheon (1866-1928) was an American novelist best known for his fictional works such as



        <emph render="italic">Graustark</emph> (1901).</p>
      <p>McCutcheon was born on July 26, 1866 to John Barr and Clara (Glick) McCutcheon in Tippecanoe County, Indiana.  As a boy, McCutcheon taught his brother John how to draw.  John went on to become a successful American cartoonist.  George McCutcheon attended Purdue University at Lafayette from 1882-1883 before leaving to work as a reporter at the



        <emph render="italic">Lafayette Journal</emph>.  "The Ante-Mortem Condition of George Ramor," printed in the



        <emph render="italic">National Magazine</emph> in 1896, was McCutcheon's first published short story.



        <emph render="italic">Graustark</emph>, written in 1901, established McCutcheon as a writer. The novel was written in a single draft at about a thousand words a day.  McCutcheon married Marie Van Antwerp Fay on September 26, 1904.  He died suddenly on October 23, 1928 while at a luncheon at the Hotel Martinique.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The



        <emph render="bold">George Barr McCutcheon Collection</emph> consists of three outgoing items of correspondence, one holograph poem, and a single item of miscellany.</p>
      <p>The



        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>, written between 1903 and 1925, includes a letter in which McCutcheon declines an invitation to write an article under the title "Love Me and the World is Mine" (06 Mar 1922), and a discussion of his satirical play about the American legal system (14 Jan 1925). The remainder of the items in the collection relate to McCutcheon's response to an appeal from Mrs. Harry S. New to contribute a poem for inclusion in a small literary magazine, the proceeds of which were to fund a local charity.  Also included in the letter is a discussion of McCutcheon's novel,



        <emph render="italic">The Sherrods</emph>:




        <blockquote>
          <p>You don't believe a man can love two women at once? I've loved a half a dozen at a time. Man is a polygamist by nature, I'm afraid, and he always tries to justify himself if he is caught. The man who loves two women loves himself much the best of the three, but he believes in himself all the time. I am not excusing Jud Sherrod. He was a disgrace and I so intended him to be. The critics are calling him the most contemptible man in fiction of this day. He was weak with a selfishness that he concealed with love. There are a good many men, my dear Mrs. New, who are confident they love two women and I think you usually find them false to both - which was more that Jud was in heart, at least.</p>
          <p>But it is a perilous discussion. We can't think alike, you know, so it's best for me to stop my side of it. I'd like to hear more from you, however. Of one thing let me remind you: love is very frequently something else with man.</p>
        </blockquote></p>
      <p>Also in the collection is a poem, "Your Humble Victim," included in the



        <emph render="bold">Writings</emph> series.  The poem was originally enclosed in the letter to Mrs. Harry S. New in which McCutcheon writes (14 Dec 1903):




        <blockquote>
          <p>I am sending some awful rot for the Katherine Home. Perhaps, if the old ladies had their choice, they'd sooner be homeless.  You know I am awful at jingles, or what you like to call them. Rhyme is an abomination with me and I think my scant reputation goes glimmering with this.</p>
        </blockquote></p>
      <p>The collection also includes an item of



        <emph render="bold">Miscellany</emph>, a 1930 signed statement by Harry S. New in which he explains the relationship between McCutcheon's letter to Mrs. New and the poem, "Your Humble Victim."</p>
