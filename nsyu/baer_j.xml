      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>John Miller Baer (1886-1970) was an American cartoonist and politician.
</p>
      <p>John Miller Baer was born on March 29, 1886 on a farm in Blackcreek, Wisconsin. After graduating from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin in 1909 with a bachelor of arts degree, Baer moved to Beach, North Dakota. Baer worked as a civil engineer, a farmer and postmaster and began submitting cartoons and articles to newspapers. 
Baer's political ideology solidified as he began to feel that big business and corruption led to farmers being taken advantage of. Baer drew cartoons for the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Non-Partisan Leader</emph> and in 1916 resigned as postmaster and moved to Fargo where he was a cartoonist for the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Fargo Courier-News</emph>. </p>
      <p>Baer entered politics as the first person elected to Congress with the endorsement of the National Nonpartisan League. He  was elected on the Nonpartisan ticket in 1916 to a seat in  the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican representative for 1st District of North Dakota.  But controversy followed Baer to Washington D.C. Baer refuted the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Times' </emph> claim that during his campaign he declared "this is no time to make an issue of Americanism" and the paper accused him of being too closely aligned with socialism.  Others in Congress insinuated that he was an unpatriotic, foreign influence. While in office, he continued to use his cartoons to influence others and received criticism from his colleagues in 1920 for drawing for the Plumb Plan League which was thought to be responsible for the railroad strike. </p>
      <p>After failing to win another term during the 1920 election, Baer returned to journalism as a cartoonist for the National Railroad Union newspaper, 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Labor</emph>, where he produced cartoons arguing for improved conditions for the American worker and the unemployed.
 </p>
      <p>John Miller Baer died in Washington, D.C. on February 18, 1970.

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">John Miller Baer Cartoons</emph> are comprised of 94 original, undated political cartoons primarily from the 1920s to the early 1940s. The populist political sentiment in Baer's cartoons is paramount as he typically depicted the plight of the average American worker or farmer affected by the negative influence of corruption. </p>
      <p>The cartoons are signed "John Baer" (some are signed "John Baer for Labor"). For some cartoons there is more than one version and several contain notes and sketches on the back. Materials used include illustration board, ink and pencil. Dimensions vary; the majority measure at least 16" x 20".  </p>
