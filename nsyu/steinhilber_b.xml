         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>Budd Steinhilber (1924-2021) was an American industrial designer and environmental activist.</p>
	  
	  <p>Born in New York City, Steinhilber graduated with Honors from Pratt Institute in 
	  1943.  His first job was with Raymond Loewy Associates in New York City, but after only a year he left to 
	  become one of the first two employees of Dohner &amp; Lippincott (later J. Gordon Lippincott &amp; Co. and 
	  then Lippincott &amp; Margulies). In 1947 Budd worked on the team that designed the short-lived Tucker 
	  automobile, producing drawings, models, and design prototypes.</p>
	  
	  <p>Soon after this, Steinhilber joined with a Lippincott colleague, his friend and fellow Pratt graduate 
	  Read Viemeister, to form Vie Design Studios, based in Yellow Springs, Ohio.   Vie's clients included the 
	  Antioch Summer Shakespeare Festival, for whom Steinhilber eventually designed sets for every one of 
	  Shakespeare's thirty-seven plays, an achievement unmatched by any other designer thus far.  (Steinhilber 
	  also appeared onstage in several productions.)  In 1951 Vie served as consultant to Steinhilber's former 
	  employer, Lippincott &amp; Margulies, on designs for the crew and officer's quarters for the USS Nautilus 
	  nuclear submarine.</p>
	  
	  <p>In 1964, Steinhilber and well-known West Coast industrial designer Gene Tepper formed Tepper &amp; 
	  Steinhilber Associates based in California.  T&amp;S was among the first to work with the then-new 
	  Silicon Valley electronics industry, designing console interfaces, optical disk storage units, video 
	  cameras, and a number of innovative medical devices.</p><p>Ten years later Steinhilber and graphic 
	  designer Barry Deutsch formed Steinhilber &amp; Deutsch, Inc.  S&amp;D's clients ran the gamut of American 
	  businesses, including Atari, Campbell's, Gallo Vineyards, Intel, Nabisco, Pabst, Northface, and Warner 
	  Communications.  The firm's work won numerous awards from the American Institute of Graphic Arts, New 
	  York Art Director's Club, San Francisco Art Director's Club, and International Design Review, and has 
	  been featured in many popular and trade publications including <emph render="italic">Product Design Annual</emph>, 
	  <emph render="italic">Japan Design</emph>, <emph render="italic">Graphics USA</emph>, 
	  <emph render="italic">AdWeek</emph>, and <emph render="italic">International Design</emph>.   In 1984 
	  Steinhilber was named a fellow of the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA).</p>
	  
	  <p>In 1987 Steinhilber "retired" and moved to Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.  
	  His interest in alternative fuel vehicles led him to serve as design advisor to the Konawaena High 
	  School's award-winning solarmobile team in the 1990 World Solar Challenge.  (The team later went on to 
	  the Swiss Tour de Sol, and drove their car across the United States from coast to coast entirely on 
	  solar power.).  That same year he founded IDSA's Environmental Responsibility Committee, and in 1991 
	  IDSA honored him at its national convention for his efforts to awaken the profession to environmental 
	  concerns.  He was one of two U.S. delegates invited to participate in a seminar on "The Eco-Design of 
	  Products" (Delft, Holland 1991) and appeared on NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw to discuss waste 
	  reduction through "design for disassembly." In 1998 he founded Personal Electric Transports (PET) 
	  to develop concepts and prototypes for battery-powered motorscooters and other small vehicles.  
	  He served as delegate to two international climate conferences, the U.N. Conference on Global 
	  Climate Change (Kyoto, 1997) and   the U.N. Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg, 2002), 
	  demonstrating some of PET's prototypes at the latter.  In February 2007 he was invited to speak on 
	  "Designing Sustainable Mobility," along with Jay Baldwin of the Buckminster Fuller Insitute and Dr. 
	  Paul Macready, designer of the Gossamer Condor and EV-1.</p>
	  
	  <p>Steinhilber has been honored many times both for his design work and for his contributios to the 
	  field in general.   He has received IDSA's  Industrial Design Excellence Award (IDEA) twice (1981 
	  and 1984); he also served on the IDEA jury in 2004.   In recognition of his efforts on behalf of the 
	  environment he received a $20,000 "Distinguished Designer Fellowship" grant from the National Endowment 
	  for the Arts (1991) and his alma mater, Pratt Institute, awarded him an Alumni Achievement Award (1993).</p>
	  
	  <p>Steinhilber was also an artist; his watercolors have been shown at the Dayton Art Institute, the 
	  Thomas Watson Gallery in New York, and many other California and Hawaii venues.</p>
	  
	  <p>Steinhilber was married twice and had three children.  He died on 25 January 2021 in Greenbrae, 
	  California, at the age of 96.</p></bioghist>
