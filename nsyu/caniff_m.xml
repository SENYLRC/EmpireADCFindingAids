      <p>Milton Arthur Caniff (1907-1988) was an American cartoonist. An important figure in the development of the newspaper comic strip, Caniff created the long-running and highly successful comic strips <emph render="italic">Terry and the Pirates</emph> and <emph render="italic">Steve Canyon</emph>.</p><p>Originally from southern Ohio, Caniff grew up in the Dayton area, the home and headquarters of the aviation pioneers the Wright Brothers (and later on, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base). Caniff studied fine arts at Ohio State University, graduating in 1930. While still in college, Caniff began working in the art department at the local <emph render="italic">Columbus Dispatch</emph> where he would encounter two of the major influences on his career—the legendary editorial cartoonist Billy Ireland, who would serve as his professional mentor, and Noel Sickles, an aspiring young artist who would later play an influential role in Caniff's stylistic development.</p><p>Caniff made the trek to New York City in 1932, signing on as a staff artist with the Associated Press. After working on a variety of comic strips—<emph render="italic">Puffy the Pig</emph>, <emph render="italic">Mister Gilfeather</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Gay Thirties</emph>—he got his big break with the adventure strip <emph render="italic">Dickie Dare</emph> in 1933. The strip soon caught the attention of the influential newspaper publisher,  Joseph Medill Patterson, who quickly hired Caniff to do a new adventure strip for his Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate. The resulting creation, <emph render="italic">Terry and the Pirates</emph>, made its newspaper debut October 2, 1934 and was an immediate success. The strip featured some compelling characters and Caniff had an innate flair for story-lines, but initially the strip didn't have the signature "look" that would ultimately distinguish it.  As many scholars have detailed,  it was the influence of Caniff's then studio-mate, Noel Sickles, that made the definitive difference. As Caniff himself  tells it:</p><p><blockquote><p>It was he [Sickles] who developed the use of heavy black-and-white, light-and-shade style (which I gratefully followed) using a brush <emph render="italic">first</emph> for all shadows, then a quill pen for the light edges. [...] The important thing here is that the elaborate illustrative style could be applied to six strips and a Sunday page <emph render="italic">by one man</emph> during a normal (seven days and nights) working week. [...] Noel Sickles contributed more to the success of the <emph render="italic">Terry</emph> drawings than any single person. (Harvey, Robert C. ed., <emph render="italic">Milton Caniff: Conversations</emph>, Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2002. p. 92-93).</p></blockquote></p><p>In 1947, after years of success with <emph render="italic">Terry and the Pirates</emph>, Caniff left the strip to fellow AP staff artist George Wunder (who continued it until 1973), and moved on to  his new creation, <emph render="italic">Steve Canyon</emph>. This strip, centered on the archetypal cold warrior and Air Force pilot, would run forty-some years and would come to typify the signature elements of Caniff's art. As with his earlier feature, the beautifully rendered, cinematic panels of <emph render="italic">Steve Canyon</emph>, visually compelling in their own right, were always subordinate to the narrative sweep of the stories. In fact, it may be Caniff's ultimate dedication to story-telling that defines his greatest artistic achievement. As his friend, the writer Pete Hamill relates: <emph render="doublequote">Milton Caniff was one of the greatest creators of popular fiction of the twentieth century</emph> (Hamill, Pete. "Milton Caniff" in <emph render="italic">Masters of American Comics</emph>, Yale University Press, 2005. p. 229).   <emph render="italic">Steve Canyon</emph> ended its run with Milton Caniff's death in 1988. </p><p>Milton Caniff has received many awards and recognitions over the course of his long career, including the Nation



al Cartoonist Society's prestigious Reuben Award in 1946 and 1971, and the Air Force Exceptional Service Award. He has received honorary doctorates from the Atlanta Law School, the University of Dayton and The Ohio State University. His work has been exhibited widely in museums and galleries, and is part of the permanent collections of the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His papers were the founding gift for the Cartoon Research Library and Museum at The Ohio State University.</p></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Milton Caniff Collection</emph> is comprised of a <emph render="bold">Cartoons</emph> series, which contains 415 daily and Sunday strips from
            the <emph render="italic">Steve Canyon</emph> newspaper comic strip (1949-1956). Mostly
            representing the years 1950-1951, the strips are in various formats. The vast majority
            are on daily proof sheets. There are 60 such sheets, each one containing 6 daily strips
            (Mon.-Sat.) (each sheet approx. 11 x 18 ½ in.). The collection also includes 52 Sunday
            proofs (each approx. 10 ½ x 15 ¾ in.), 1 Sunday color proof (approx. 13 ¾ x 16 ¾ in.), 2
            daily tear sheets (image approx. 3 x 10 in.) and 3 Sunday tear sheets (image approx. 9 ½
            x 13 in.).</p>
