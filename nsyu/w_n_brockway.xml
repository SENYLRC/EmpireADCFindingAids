         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>William N. Brockway (1829-1889) was the owner of a successful carriage-manufacturing business in Homer and Cortland, New York.</p>
		
		<p>Brockway's father was a cabinet-maker and Brockway ran the business for a number of years until embarking 
		on the manufacture of carriages in 1875.  According to a highly complimentary obituary published in 
		<emph render="italic">The Hub</emph> (alternate title: <emph render="italic">The Automotive Manufacturer</emph>), 
		Volume XXXI (1890), page 607: "He was emphatically a self-made man, and some idea of [his] sterling business 
		characteristics...may be formed from the fact that  his first year's business was  just one hundred platform 
		spring wagons, and that at the time of his death the annual output of the firm amounts to between four and five 
		thousand vehicles."    After his death Brockway Carriage Works continued under family ownership, eventually 
		shifting to gasoline and electric vehicles as Brockway Motor Truck in 1912.  During World War II the company 
		produced trucks for the U.S. Army (the C-666) and in 1955 it added diesel vehicles to its line.  In 1959 the 
		company was purchased by Mack Truck of Allentown, Pennsylvania, but continued to operate as an independent 
		subsidiary, its vehicles identifiable by the "Brockway huskie."  In 1962 it landed a contract to supply heavy 
		trucks for the U.S. Navy and Air Force, and throughout the 1960s and early 1970s the company continued to 
		introduce innovations including the Huskiedrive (1967).  Labor issues eventually put an end to the company in 
		1977, after more than a hundred years.</p>

		<p>Oscar Shaw Greenleaf (b. 1876) owned and 
		operated the Greenleaf Hotel in Otisville, New York.   He was a member of Hoffman Lodge No. 412, F. and A. M., of Middletown, New York and Midland Chapter No. 240, R. A. M.  He also evidently sold carriages, whether to his guests or to the public in general cannot be determined.</p>
