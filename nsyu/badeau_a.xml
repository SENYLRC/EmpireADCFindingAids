      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Adam Badeau was a soldier, diplomat, and military secretary to Ulysses S. Grant.  Born in New York City on December 29, 1831, he joined the military in 1862 and served as aide to General Thomas W. Sherman until he was wounded in 1863.  In March of 1864 he was appointed military secretary to General Ulysses S. Grant and eventually promoted to colonel. He was with Grant until March 1869 and was present at the Confederate surrender at Appomattox; he retired from the army with the full rank of captain and the brevet rank of Brigadier-General.  From 1869 to 1881 he was in London, first as secretary of legation and then as consul-general, with a leave of absence granted by the state department from 1877-1878 to accompany General Grant on his tour round the world. He later served as consul-general at Havana, from 1882 to 1884.  He died in 1895.</p>
     <p>Badeau assisted Grant in the preparation of Grant's <emph render="italic">Memoirs</emph> and authored a number of books and articles on military subjects. His published works include <emph render="italic">The Vagabond</emph>, a collection of essays (New York, 1859); a three-volume <emph render="italic">Military History of Ulysses S. Grant</emph> (1867-1881); <emph render="italic">Conspiracy: a Cuban Romance</emph> (1885) ; <emph render="italic">Aristocracy in England</emph> (1886); and <emph render="italic">Grant in Peace</emph>, a biographical profile of the General (1886).</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Adam Badeau Manuscript</emph> is an undated single item, "War Stories for Children: the <emph render="italic">Merrimac</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Monitor</emph>."  The manuscript, which recounts the 1862 Civil War battle of Hampton Roads between the two ironclad warships, consists of 30 handwritten pages with numerous corrections and annotations.  Edited to read "War Stories for Boys and Girls," the manuscript begins thus:</p><p><blockquote><p>In the first year of the Civil War, at Norfolk, in Virginia, and at the same time in Brooklyn, in the State of New York, there was building a ship unlike any that had ever been seen in this world.  Up to that time the navies of every nation had been made of wood, and when a wooden shipis struck in battle, every child knows it may be set on fire, or so torn to pieces that unless the rush of water into her hole is instantly stopped, the ship must sink.  This is what makes a sea-fight so terrible.</p></blockquote></p>
