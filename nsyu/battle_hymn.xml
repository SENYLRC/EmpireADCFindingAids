		<p>Born in 1907 in New York, Michael Blankfort was a writer, lyricist, director, and producer.  He wrote a number of plays and musicals early in his career beginning with <emph render="italic">Merry-Go-Round</emph> in 1932; <emph render="italic">Battle Hymn</emph> was his sixth work, produced by the Federal Theatre Project of the WPA.  In the 1940s he moved into film and then television, penning Westerns, dramas and adventure tales, and in 1950 he won the Writer's Guild of America's award for Best Written Western for <emph render="italic">Broken Arrow</emph>.  He also wrote novels and short stories, many of which were adapted for the screen.    He served as president of the Writer's Guild of America (West) from 1967-1969, and from 1969-1971 he was a governor of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Michael Blankfort died in 1987.</p><p>Michael Gold, writer,  was also  born in New York in 1894, the son of Jewish immigrants (his original surname was Granich). Although not born into poverty, his father's health and business failed when Gold was still young, forcing him to go to work at age 12 to help support his family.  While working as a manual laborer, Gold began to write about his experiences with poverty and about his fellow laborers.  His radical political views found a congenial home in socialist journals such as the <emph render="italic">Masses</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Call</emph>, and he became successful enough that he was able to leave manual labor altogether and support himself solely through his writing.  In 1920 he became associate editor of <emph render="italic">The Liberator</emph> and six years later Gold and his friend, John Sloan, became joint editors of the <emph render="italic">New Masses</emph>.  At the time of <emph render="italic">Battle Hymn</emph>, he had one play and one musical to his credit and had recently published a successful novel, <emph render="italic">Jews Without Money</emph>.  His other books include <emph render="italic">120 Million</emph> (1929) and  <emph render="italic">Change the World</emph> (1937). Michael Gold died in 1967.</p></bioghist>
