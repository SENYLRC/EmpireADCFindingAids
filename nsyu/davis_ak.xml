      <p>Angela Kirkham Davis (1827-1919) was an American author living in a border slave state during the American Civil War.  She was born on May 26, 1827 in Batavia, New York.

        <emph render="bold">Angela K. Davis Typescript</emph> is a narrative that describes Davis's experiences during the time period leading up to the Battle at Antietam, which took place not far from her home in Funkstown, Maryland. She relates the tensions as well as the friendships between the "Secessionists" and the "Yankees" in her town and the divisions that took place within families and friends, and attempts to explain the reasons why Maryland did not ultimately secede.</p>
      <p>The volume begins with a short narrative of the events leading up to the war, in particular the march of the Massachusetts troops through Baltimore and the confrontation that took place between soldiers and citizens. She then describes the Union encampments she visited, the phenomena of Union soldiers marching through her town, and the influx of freed slaves from Virginia.</p>
      <p>When Frederick was occupied by Lee's forces, the tide was turned, and the Confederates flooded through town, needing shelter and food and relying on the Christian charity of women such as Angela Kirkham Davis. Her husband had fled north at this point, but joined her again as the Confederate forces were pushed back and the Battle of Antietam formed. They visited the aftermath of the battle together, bringing food and supplies to the Union troops, and experiencing the bloody remainder of the Union battlions. Angela Kirkham Davis's narrative of her personal experiences of the horrors of war and the effect it had on the citizen population of both sides expresses the cruel reality of brother fighting against brother in a state that supported the loyalties of both sides.</p>
