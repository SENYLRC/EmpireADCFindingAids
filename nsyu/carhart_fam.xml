      <p>The Carharts were a prominent business family from Collamer, New York. Peter Sanford Carhart (b. 1826) was a farmer, inventor, and manufacturer who designed farm implements such as the Carhart's Two-Horse Cultivator. Peter and his wife Lucia Hulburt (b. 1841) had six children, including their first son Herbert Addison Carhart (1868-1941) and their daughter Angie Electra Carhart (1871-1964). Herbert was an engineer and inventor like his father who lived in Syracuse, NY with his wife Nellie M. Mead (1864-1960).  </p></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Carhart Family Home Remedy Scrapbook</emph> is a small notebook used as a scrapbook for various housekeeping recipes and formulas. The notebook appears to have been first used in the 1850s to record financial transactions, probably by Peter Carhart whose name is stamped on the outside. The first 40 pages contain handwritten records of money paid by various individuals to the owner. Unfortunately, most of these original entries are now unreadable as they are covered by newspaper clippings and scraps of paper. Other names included in the book are "H. A. Carhart, Collamer, N.Y." (stamped on a piece of paper) and Angie Carhart (written on a postcard addressed to her).</p><p>The notebook appears to have been inherited by a later Carhart (probably Herbert or Angie) and then used as a scrapbook for home remedies and housekeeping formulas. The entries include remedies for various human and animal ailments, formulas for cleaning solutions and home repairs, cooking recipes, gardening advice, and other household tips. Many of these remedies and recipes are newspaper clippings, while others are handwritten in the notebook or on scraps of paper. Most entries are undated, but appear to be from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century.</p>
