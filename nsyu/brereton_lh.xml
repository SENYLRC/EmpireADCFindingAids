         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>Lewis Hyde Brereton (1890-1967) was a military aviator and United States Army Air Forces 
		officer.  He graduated from  the U.S. Naval Academy in 1911, served with distinction in World 
		War I and World War II, and retired in 1948 with the rank of General.</p>
		
		<p>Brereton was one of the first military pilots of the United States Army, assigned to the 
		Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps in September 1912.  He remained on active duty in the air services branch continuously until it eventually became the United States Air Force in 1947, the only service member to do so.  
		During World War I he served in France on the staff of General Benjamin D. Foulois, commander 
		of the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force.  In 1918 he was given command of the 
		12th Aero Squadron and at the close of the war he held the rank of lieutenant colonel.</p>
		
		<p>Between the wars he was assistant military attach√© for air at the U.S. Embassy in Paris 
		from 1920-1922.  He served as commanding officer of the 10th School Group in at Kelly Field, 
		Texas where he oversaw the training of American pilots and was also an instructor at the Air 
		Service Tactical School at Langley Air Force Base.   In 1925 he served as co-counsel for the 
		defense at the court-martial of Billy Mitchell.   During the late 1920s he suffered personal 
		setbacks, including excessive drinking and the dissolution of his marriage of 14 years, but by 
		1931 he had recovered his focus and his career was back on track.</p>
		
		<p>During World War II he served in combat theaters continuously from the attack on Pearl 
		Harbor to the German surrender.  He was chosen personally by General Douglas MacArthur in 1941 
		to command the Far East Air Force and was later appointed commander of United States Army 
		Middle East Air Forces and then of the First Allied Airborne Army.  Forces  under his command 
		took place in Operations Overlord, Cobra, Market Garden and Varsity.</p>
		
		<p>Brereton's post-war career included  positions as commander of the Third Air Force at 
		MacDill in Florida, Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee to the U.S. Atomic Energy 
		Commission,  and secretary general of the Air Board.  In 1946 he published his  memoirs, 
		<emph render="italic">The Brereton Diaries</emph>, about his wartime experiences.</p><p>Lt. General Brereton received numerous citations and awards during his career.  These include the Distinguished Service Cross ("for extraordinary heroism in action"), Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, and Distinguished Flying Cross, as well as awards from France (Commander and Officer of the Legion of Honor; Croix de Guerre with Palm), England (Companion, Order of the Bath) and the Netherlands (Grand Officer, Order of Orange-Nassau).  He was described by a former subordinate, Major General Cecil F. Combs, as "a cocky, aggressive, intelligent, experienced, pretty damn able commander."</p><p>See also his full biography at <extref href="http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=4788">http://www.af.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioID=4788</extref>.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Lewis H. Brereton Papers</emph> consists of correspondence, 
			memorabilia, and miscellaneous.</p>
			
			<p>The bulk of the <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> consists of letters from Brereton 
			to his first wife, Helen.  They are written from various locations where Brereton was posted, 
			including San Francisco (1913), Fort Rosecrans in San Diego (1913-1914), Paris and 
			Bordeaux (1917), Tours, Issoudun and Amanty (1918), Coblenz (1919), Paris (1919-1921), and 
			Kelly Field, Texas (1923-1924).   The letters are intimate and loving but occasionally frustrated, and highlight the difficulties in maintaining a military marriage.  A number of the envelopes bear later annotations, presumably 
			by Helen, expressing regret over the end of their marriage.  One from 12 Jan 1914 reads, "I think I was afraid to have him know how much I cared," and another from 29 Sep 1919, "My darling, I have hurt you again!  Can God ever forgive?"   The last letter, postmarked 20 Jul 1924, is annotated on the envelope "My last love letter," and in it Brereton says he is going to a sanatarium "in the Pennsylvania mountains...I sort of checked out last night and feel pretty rocky...I'm not going to write so don't worry -- I realize that I love you and couldn't do anything else than love you.  But I want rest, rest, rest."   There are also some later letters 
			from Brereton to his son Jimmy, and some correspondence with his bank in Paris.</p>
			
			<p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> contains additional scraps (envelopes, slips of paper) with Helen's later notes, 
			including a faded red ribbon which was originally tied around a bundle of the letters; clippings 
			about Brereton's achievements in the military; insignia from the U.S. Third Army; Brerton's 
			personal file with military orders, letters of citation, etc.; Brereton's diplomatic passport; 
			and an undated photograph of him.</p>

			<p><emph render="bold">Miscellaneous</emph> consists of writings; one is not by Brereton and 
			the other three have no author given.  Two items are papers or 
			essays on the activities of the American air forces during World War I, one is a typescript of an 
			article in French with a byline of "Whyte Williams," and one is a typescript poem entitled "Hunka 
			Tin."  This last, dated June 2, 1918,  is in praise of Ford automobiles and is a parody of Kipling's well-known 
			poem "Gunga Din."  The last line reads, "You tin, tin, tin, hunka-tin / You exasperating puzzle, hunka-tin / I've abused you and I've flayed you / But by Henry Ford who made you / You're better than a Packard, hunka-tin!"</p>
