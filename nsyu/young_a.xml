         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>Art Young (1866-1943) was an American cartoonist and active in the socialist movement. </p><p>Born in 1866, Young grew up in Monroe, Wisconsin and had his first illustrations published at the age of seventeen.  He studied at the Academy of Design in Chicago while working as an illustrator of news stories for the <emph render="italic">Chicago Evening Mail</emph>, but in 1895 he moved to New York City where he studied at the Art Students League and began to move towards a more radical political viewpoint.   </p><p>By 1902 Young's work was so highly valued that newspapers and magazines were willing to accept his drawings attacking inequality and supporting causes he believed in, such as women's rights.  In 1910 Young went to work for the Socialist magazine <emph render="italic">The Masses</emph>, where he was free  to fully express his radical views.  Despite a libel charge in 1913 and <emph render="italic">The Masses' </emph> loss of their mailing privileges in 1917 for their outspoken opposition to World War I, Young continued to draw "inflammatory" cartoons for the magazine until it ceased publication in 1918.  He went on to do cartoons for <emph render="italic">The Liberator</emph> and <emph render="italic">Good Morning</emph>, both of which he had helped establish, as well as for the <emph render="italic">Saturday Evening Post</emph>, the <emph render="italic">Nation</emph>, <emph render="italic">New Masses</emph> and the <emph render="italic">New Leader</emph>. </p><p>Young, after running for the New York State Assembly with the Socialist Party in 1913, illustrated work for other Socialist Party candidates. He published his well-known autobiography, <emph render="italic">Art Young: His Life and Times,</emph> in 1939, which also features a selection of his cartoon artwork. 
 </p><p>Art Young died in 1943.</p><blockquote><p>"I think we have the true religion. If only the crusade would take on more converts. But faith, like the faith they talk about in the churches, is ours and the goal is not unlike theirs, in that we want the same objectives but want it here on earth and not in the sky when we die." [Art Young, in an interview with Gil Wilson, 1940]</p></blockquote></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Art Young Collection</emph> contains a set of postcards and one telegram. </p><p>The twelve postcards were drawn by political cartoonist Art Young and issued by the Good Morning Co., publishers of the radical journal <emph render="italic">Good Morning</emph>.  The postcards depict various fictional figures accompanied by satirical text, such as Reverend A. Jawbunk, who preached "an eloquent sermon yesterday on 'Social Unrest, the Peril of the Twentieth Century';"   Karl Muddlechump, who "says that the way to cure the Bolshevistic unrest the world over is to spread the news at least every six weeks that the Russian Soviet Government has fallen;" and Henry Sniff Hound, who proposes that the "intellectual, moral, and material force of the world...be exerted against the spreading of...communist doctrines." The postcards are undated but from between 1919 and 1921.</p><p>Also there is one telegram written in pencil and signed by Young appearing on a Postal Telegraph Company form with "Danbury" written at the top. The telegram is addressed to "Mr. Chairman" and is regarding "Labor Party Rally". The message reads, "Canâ€™t get to the meeting tonight- but heart and soul with the movement." It is undated but possibly from the 1930s.  </p>
