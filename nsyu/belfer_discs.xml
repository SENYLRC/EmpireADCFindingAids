      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Joseph and Max Bell established the Bell Music Box record shop in Manhattan, New York City following World War II. 
         The brothers were Russian immigrants, who spent time in Cuba before coming to America. While in Cuba, they took an interest in Spanish language recordings
         as well as the music of the Caribbean.  Their store was known to record aficionados and collectors nationwide and was comprehensive in its breadth -- if they did not have a copy of a particular recording, they would make their own.  As a result, their inventory contained both commercially produced and sold recordings, and personal copies made for their own reference and use.</p><p>In 1963, Syracuse University purchased the entire inventory of the Bell Brothers' store.  Commercial recordings were integrated into the <archref href="../b/belfer_discs.htm">Belfer Commercial Phonograph Disc Recordings</archref>.  Latin American and Caribbean recordings were separated into the <archref href="../b/bell_latin.htm">Bell Brothers Collection of Latin American and Caribbean Recordings</archref>.  Noncommercial recordings were retained as the <archref href="../b/bell_brothers.htm">Bell Brothers Collection</archref>.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Belfer Commercial Phonograph Disc Collection</emph> consists of commercially produced phonograph disc recordings in speeds ranging from 45 RPM to 78 RPM.      Cataloged items may be located by searching &summitref;.  There is no searchable online tool for uncataloged items at this time. However, if the researcher can 
		 provide the label (record company name) and record number, we can perform a shelf check to determine whether we have the item.</p><p><emph render="underline">78 RPMs (inclusive dates: 1890-1954)</emph></p><p>This subset of the collection consists of   60 to 80 RPM recordings, in 5", 6", 7", 8", 9", 
		 9.5", 10", 11" and 12" sizes.  The collection holds 195,455 unique titles on individual records and in multi-record album sets. 
		 When counted individually the collection holds over 500,000 records containing over 800,000 individual tracks. Since the 
		 founding of the collection in 1962, it has specialized in preserving the recordings of Thomas Edison.  The collection 
		 contains 4,000 Edison Diamond Discs.</p>
		 <p>The recordings include instrumental music, popular, opera, novelty, vocal 
		 performances and spoken word in many languages, though English is the most frequently represented language.  
		 Among the 5-to-9.5 inch discs there are early recordings prepared for the 1909 World's Fair.  While the collection 
		 encompasses a cross section of classical, popular and spoken word recordings from around the world, the focus of the 
		 collection is on Edison Diamond Discs and American popular music record labels.  </p>
		 
		 <p>Approximately 88% of the collection has been cataloged and may be located by searching &summitref;.   The remaining items 
		 (approximately 21,000 10" and 12" recordings) are not currently searchable by the public.  However, if the researcher can 
		 supply the record company name and record number, staff can search our in-house database to determine whether we have the 
		 item.  <extref href="belfer_78s_labels.pdf">A list of labels</extref> is available in PDF format.</p>
      <p><emph render="underline">45 RPMs (inclusive dates: 1948-1990)</emph></p>
		 
		 
		 
      <p>This subset of the collection consists of 7-inch 45 rpm commercial recordings of American popular music.   There are approximately 15,800 discs representing more than 30,000 songs.  The vast majority of the recordings are American pop music singles aimed at the radio listening public.  <extref href="belfer_45s_labels.pdf">A list of labels</extref> is available in PDF format.</p><p><emph render="underline">LPs (inclusive dates: 1949-1995; bulk dates: 1949-1970)</emph></p><p>This subset of the collection consists of 10" and 12" 33 1/3 RPM 
		 commercially produced recordings with a focus on American record labels.   The collection contains 52,500 discs with instrumental, spoken word and vocal performances in many languages, 
		 though English is the most frequently represented language.  While the collection encompasses a cross section of classical, 
		 popular and spoken word recordings from around the world and all genres, the emphasis is on vocal and instrumental jazz and 
		 vocal and instrumental classical music. <extref href="belfer_lps_labels.pdf">A list of labels</extref> is available in PDF format.</p></scopecontent>
