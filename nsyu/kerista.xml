      <p>The Kerista Commune was a moderately successful urban commune based in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, existing from 1971 to 1991.  Membership varied over the years, but at its largest it was slightly less than 30 men, women and children. Founded by John Presmont (Brother Jud) and Eve Furchgott (Even Eve) in 1971 (though Presmont had founded Kerista as a religion as early as 1956), all members agreed to the same social contract in order to join. Social contract standards ranged from 'Total Rationality at All Times' to 'Clean Up Your Own Mess'.

 The commune also practiced Gestalt Therapy (members would verbally encounter themselves, friends and sometimes strangers about their neuroses), and communal living and finances.  The Commune also practiced polyfidelity (members were faithful to a family group, called a Best Friend Identity Cluster or BFIC, within which they rotated sleeping arrangements), and coined the word "compersion" as "the opposite of jealousy, positive feelings
about your partner's other intimacies."</p><p>The Commune was based on the idea of independent learning, self-education, and the creative use of technology to find novel solutions to the world's problems.  Projects ranged from the simple to the highly ambitious and  included self-esteem workshops, creative visualization, drama (Theater Verit√©, the Cosmic Opera),  social justice, assistance for veterans (Presmont was a World War II veteran), free courses and rap groups, formation of a network of  intentional communities ("Kerista Global Village"), newsletters and zines (<emph render="italic">The Storefront Classroom</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Utopian Classroom</emph>, <emph render="italic">Rockhead</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Node</emph>, others) and books.    Kerista Commune members also formed the executive leadership and held many staff positions of Abacus, Inc, a highly successful Apple computer reseller in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p><p>The Kerista Commune broke up in 1992, triggered in large part by feelings among many members that Presmont was not holding hiimself to the same standards he demanded of others.  Presmont continued his work (incorporated as the World Academy of Keristan Education, or WAKEINC),  until he died in 2009.</p><p>[Preceding adapted from information on the Kerista Commune website, <extref href="http://www.kerista.com/">http://www.kerista.com/</extref></p></bioghist>
      
      <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Kerista Commune Collection</emph> consists of pamphlets, broadsides, fliers, course descriptions, and assorted other publications and printed material produced by the Commune and its members.  </p><p>It is extremely important to bear in mind that many (if not all) of the projects undertaken by the group were interrelated and  interwoven, and projects also grew out of, merged with and split from each other over time in an organic manner.  In addition, much of the material for a given project was reused, recycled, reissued,  recopied, recompiled, and projects sometimes changed names over time.  As a result, despite the fact that the collection has been roughly divided by type of material, there is an enormous amount of overlap across the entire collection.</p><p><emph render="bold">Background information</emph> consists of selected items that provide some background information about the Kerista Commune and Jud Presmont.  This includes the articles of incorporation for Presmont's post-Kerista organization, the World Academy of Keristan Education; a handbill with the "Basic 17 Standards" for the University of Utopia/Storefront Classroom; a published scholarly article on the commune's practice of polyfidelity; a questionnaire on the commune, and various formal and informal statements on why the commune dissolved.</p>
			<p>A small amount of <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> includes a few memos from Presmont to the group as well as letters from Presment to John F. Kennedy, Jr. and to the White House Director of Media Affairs.</p>
			<p><emph render="bold">Newsletters</emph> contains scattered issues of two newsletters issued by the commune, <emph render="italic">Utopian Eyes</emph> and <emph render="italic">Workers' Paradise</emph>.   (Additional issues of the newsletters have been cataloged and can be located through &summitref;.)</p>
			<p>Most of the material produced by the Commune was, unsurprisingly, communally produced and bears no specific author's name.  <emph render="bold">Presmont material</emph> contains presentations, slide shows and compilations whose title pages explicitly states that they were written by Jud Presmont.  Some of these may date from after Presmont's departure from the group, but this cannot be determined for certain since almost nothing is dated.</p>
			<p><emph render="bold">Projects</emph> contains a wide assortment of material produced by the group, including fliers, brochures, handbills, publications, presentations, summaries, course descriptions, and more.  Where items involved a single specific project such as "Gestalt-o-rama" or the Big Rock Candy Mountain Monumental Art Project, they are foldered together.    As mentioned above, projects overlapped with each other to a greater or lesser degree.  Some of the items were apparently intended as presentations to potential financial backers as they include dollar amounts.</p>
