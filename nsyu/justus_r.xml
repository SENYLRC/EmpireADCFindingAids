      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Roy Braxton Justus (1901-1983) was an award-winning American editorial cartoonist. </p>
      <p>Born in Avon, South Dakota in 1901, Justus had his first exhibition while still in high school, a selection of cartoons about World War I displayed in the local drugstore.   He attended Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa and went to work as a cartoonist
                                                  for the <emph render="italic">Sioux City Tribune</emph> where he stayed for 17
                                                  years with brief stints in Washington D.C. and in
                                                  New York with the Associated Press. In 1944, after
                                                  three years with the <emph render="italic">Sioux City Journal</emph>, Justus
                                                  became the editorial cartoonist for the
                                                  <emph render="italic">Minneapolis Star</emph>. His editorial cartoons were also
                                                  syndicated to newspapers around the United States
                                                  through the Register and Tribune Syndicate. </p>
      <p>Justus served as vice president and president of the newly formed American Association of Editorial Cartoonists (AAEC). He was also a
                                                  member of the National Cartoonists Society, the
                                                  National Press Club and the Minneapolis Press
                                                  Club. His work was recognized by several
                                                  organizations. Justus received the 1965 Sigma
                                                  Delta Chi Award, several Freedom Foundation
                                                  awards, the National Headliner’s Club Award and
                                                  the Christopher Award. Morningside College
                                                  presented him with an honorary doctorate of
                                                  letters in 1965.</p>
      <p> Justus retired from his duties at the <emph render="italic">Minneapolis Star</emph> in 1975 and died on May 19, 1983. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Roy Justus Papers</emph>  represent three decades of Justus' career as an editorial cartoonist. In addition to providing a window into Justus' artistic and journalistic career, the collection also documents,  in correspondence and photographs, Justus' relationship with president Lyndon Johnson. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Artwork</emph> (1938-1975) is subdivided into works by Justus and works
                                                  by Others. The majority are
                                                  original editorial cartoons by Justus for the
                                                  Minneapolis <emph render="italic">Star Tribune</emph>.  There is one
                                                  box  of Justus' work for the <emph render="italic">Sioux City Journal</emph>.
                                                  Most pieces of artwork have dates written or stamped on the back; the years 1942-1946 have been arranged
                                                  alphabetically by caption, as they are undated.    <emph render="italic">Sioux City Journal</emph>
                                                  artwork is undated but from approximately 1941-1943.
                                                  Justus usually worked in ink and crayon on illustration board, using thin lines with an image size of 9”
                                                  x 10 ½”.  Captions are written in pencil or ink.
                                                  Interleaves are original, as received from the donor.  </p>
      <p>Also in this series are individual cartoons  by other artists inscribed to Justus. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> (1931-1983) contains incoming correspondence and
                                                  selected replies from Justus.  Topics include requests for
                                                  permissions and other business matters, and responses
                                                  from readers who frequently included clippings of
                                                  his editorial cartoons with their specific
                                                  complaints.  There are scattered insulting drawings referring to him as the "king
                                                  of hate." One frequent correspondent is Willie Day
                                                  Taylor, President Lyndon Johnson’s assistant,
                                                  asking for original cartoons for LBJ’s personal
                                                  collection. There are also letters from
                                                  Hubert Humphrey and Richard Nixon, IBM, the
                                                  Encyclopedia Britannica, cartoonists Rollin Kirby
                                                  and Jay “Ding” Darling.    A number of letters are from Syracuse
                                                  University Library staff about the donation of
                                                  the collection, and there is one letter about
                                                  Justus’ death, addressed to his wife. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia </emph>(1944-1975) consists of awards, photographs and
                                                  printed material.  Included here are awards in various forms (e.g. medals) from
                                                  the Freedom Foundation, Sigma Chi Delta and the
                                                  National Headliners Club, and associated printed
                                                  material related to recognitions.  Also in this series are 51 scrapbooks (1941-1969) containing daily
                                                  clippings of Justus' editorial cartoons. There is
                                                  also one scrapbook of other material. </p>
      <p>Of particular interest are the photographs, including pictures of Justus at the Johnson presidential
                                                  library, Justus with Richard Nixon and Hubert

                                                  at the Cape Kennedy Missile Test Annex and
                                                  portraits of Justus. There are also two candid
                                                  color snapshots showing Lyndon Johnson behind the
                                                  wheel of a convertible, with Justus and others in
                                                  the car including Albany <emph render="italic">Times Union </emph>cartoonist Hy
                                                  Rosen. The photos from June 1971 were taken at
                                                  Johnson’s Texas ranch.  Almost all the photographs are black and white 8x10s. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Printed material</emph> (1921-1975) contains primarily clippings about
