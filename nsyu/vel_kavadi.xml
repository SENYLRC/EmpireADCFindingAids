      <p>[Description taken from dealer catalog.]  The Vel Kavadi ritual is one of many well known Indian yogic, penance, and endurance
practices done for the purpose of ritual purification; these were later embraced by Stelarc and the Anglo-American "Modern Primitives" movement, and influenced especially Fakir Musafar, London's Mr. Sebastian,
and Charles Gatewood.</p><p><emph render="italic">Kavadi</emph> is Tamil for "yoke," and refers to the the large metal frame that is often decorated
with flowers and peacock feathers that devotees construct as an act of sacred veneration to carry on their shoulders. <emph render="italic">Vel</emph> is derived from "lance" and refers to the long spikes (as many as 100) that are attached to the <emph render="italic">kavadi</emph> and that pierce the devotee's flesh, creating a cage-like structure that is then borne and walked with. Penitents are instructed to take <emph render="italic">kavadi</emph> in dreams, and vows are often made to pay dues for sacred favors or for pure love and devotion. Preparation
for carrying the <emph render="italic">kavadi</emph> is the culmination of a period of ritual purification and sexual abstinence. Devotees wear yellow, live in the temple, and spend their days constructing the <emph render="italic">kavadi</emph>, with little sleep and vegetarian food only
once a day (Ward, p. 319).</p><p>Variations of this ritual for the deity Murugan are performed across the non-western Hindu world. The origins of the ritual and its paraphernalia
lie in a number of stories from the Hindu epics: "According to Hindu mythology, the tribute to Murugan is connected with his assistance to the devas (celestial beings) and martial victory over the forces of evil. Placed on a golden chariot adorned with precious gems, with his <emph render="italic">vel</emph> (lance) and peacock,
Murugan is taken to represent the struggle of good over evil and to symbolize virtue, bravery, youth, power, courage, vitality, and valor" (Ward, pp. 317-318). The <emph render="italic">kavadi</emph> may also be symbolic of the hills that the giant Idumban once slung over his shoulder and carried away on poles (Ward, p. 318).</p><p>Ward, Colleen.  "Thaipusam in Malaysia: A Psycho-Anthropological Analysis of Ritual Trance, Ceremonial Possession and Self- Mortification Practices," <emph render="italic">Ethos</emph>, Vol.
12, No. 4 (Winter 1984).</p></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p> [Description taken from dealer catalog.]  The <emph render="bold">Vel Kavadi Photograph Album</emph> is a collection of fifty images from the first third of the twentieth century depicting a ritual of great significance to Western body modification culture. Photographs in the album record the entire ritual and related events, including the carrying of <emph render="italic">kavadi</emph> on a processional
route in the environs of a temple. The photographs show ash-smeared devotees in and out of states of ecstatic and ritual trance, a large variety of piercings (cheek, back, lip) with weights and bells attached, as well as <emph render="italic">kavadi</emph> on their shoulders
being attended to by experts and priests. The expert attendants are crucial for certain piercings and the ash is smeared on the body to staunch blood flow.  Though unquestionably of anthropological significance,
the album is perhaps even more noteworthy as a work of original
vernacular photography. Images are skillfully shot, perspectives creatively framed, and subjects carefully considered. The unknown photographer creates a book of exceptionally intimate portraiture as well as an early and rare photographic study of this important religious ritual.</p>
