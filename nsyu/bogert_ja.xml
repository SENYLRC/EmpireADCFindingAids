      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>John A. Bogert (circa 1836-?) was a Union soldier, an officer in the 127th New York Volunteer Infantry 
	  and a lieutenant colonel in the 103rd Colored Infantry.</p>
	  <p>Bogert was the son of Jacob C. Bogert of New York City.  He enlisted as a private in Company B, 9th 
	  Regiment, New York Volunteers Infantry in 1861, rising to corporal (date uncertain).  He was promoted to 
	  first lieutenant of Company B, 127th New York Volunteers Infantry (1 September 1862) and then to captain 
	  (1 May 1863) of the same regiment.  Part of his service was spent on the Yorktown Peninsula in Virginia.  
	  From there, in the summer of 1863, he was assigned to the forces which were besieging Charleston, South 
	  Carolina.   This duty involved little if any military action and he spent most of his time on administrative 
	  duties.  At the end of October 1864 he was assigned to Beaufort, South Carolina, as provost marshal, thus 
	  becoming responsible for its government.</p>
	  <p>On 17 February 1865 he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 103d U.S. Colored Infantry.  After the 
	  war, while the Union Army was an occupying force in the former Confederate states, Lt. Col. Bogert had 
	  governmental duties in both Thomasville and Macon, Georgia.  He was discharged at Savannah, Georgia in 1866.  
	  His application for membership in the Grand Army of the Republic (a Union veterans' organization) lists his 
	  occupation as "marble worker."</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">John A. Bogert Papers</emph> consists of correspondence and military records.</p>
	  <p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> is, with two exceptions, outgoing from Bogert to his parents.  Of the two incoming letters, 
	  one (29 Sep 1862) is 
	  to then-Captain Bogert from his father Jacob during Bogert's stay at Camp Gurney, near Washington D.C., and 
	  the other (21 Oct 1862) is to Bogert from his brother Willie.  All but one of Bogert's outgoing letters are 
	  dated, although internal evidence suggests that two are dated incorrectly (14 May 1863 mentions the 
	  Battle of the Wilderness which in fact took  place in May of 1864; Dec 1865 mentions Sherman's presence in 
	  South Carolina, suggesting a date of Dec 1864).  These two letters are filed under the corrected dates.</p>
	  <p>The letters contain information regarding family matters, camp life in the army, the siege and 
	  bombardment of Charleston, the securing of a regimental chaplain, the formation of a regimental band, escaped 
	  slaves, Bogert's duties as provost marshal of Beaufort (South Carolina), the celebration at Fort Sumter of 
	  the end of the war, postwar Charleston, and Bogert's responsibilities in charge of the military occupation 
	  of Thomasville and Macon, Georgia.  Included in the latter is Bogert's account of a violent confrontation 
	  between citizens and black soldiers in Macon.  A transcript, and occasionally an envelope, accompanies each 
	  letter.</p>
	  <p>The two items in <emph render="bold">Military records</emph> are Bogert's application for membership in the Grand Army of the Republic and the 
	  muster-out roll from his promotion to captain in May 1863.</p>
