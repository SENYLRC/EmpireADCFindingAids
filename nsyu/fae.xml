      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>The Fund for Adult Education (FAE) was a subsidiary foundation established and supported by the Ford Foundation. Founded in 1951, the Fund had as its purpose to aid and to encourage liberal adult education especially in political, economic, and international affairs and the humanities, with emphasis on study-discussion. However, because of the coincidence of history, the Fund became the main instrument in the establishment of an educational broadcasting system (particularly ETV) in the United States. The Fund had its own board of directors and staff, and it was both a grant-giving and an operating organization. During its early years, the Fund financed the sometimes controversial Test Cities experiment, the purpose of which was to ascertain the best ways to coordinate and stimulate adult education activities, community by community. The Test Cities Project involved individuals and institutions in thirteen United States communities in an experimental and novel educational project. Each of the participating Test Cities programs was independent of the Fund and controlled its own programs. The Fund officially ended its activities in 1961, although it continued as a legal entity (just as some of the projects to which it gave long-term grants continued) after 1961.

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Fund for Adult Education (FAE) Records</emph> contain correspondence, published material, reports, and work files of Fund projects that date from 1950, the year prior to the organization's founding. Bull: dates of the collection are 1951 to 1958, although some printed material dates to 1969. The collection is arranged by broad subject categories in 97 boxes and one package that total 70 linear feet. Most of the collection deals with Fund-operated projects, mainly study-discussion programs.

</p>
      <p>Boxes 1-31 contain the files of the Fund's 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Test Cities</emph> experiment. The first five boxes contain general files,  largely correspondence, but there are also  there are files, arranged by community name, of the projects undertaken in the thirteen communities that were involved in the program. These latter files typically contain correspondence, project histories, newsletters, reports, and news-clippings. A restriction on research access to the Fund for Adult Education Test Cities files, specified by the donor, limits access to professional persons in the field of educational history and research and further stipulates that no quotation from any letter, memorandum, report, or any other document in the Test Cities files be made without the written permission of the person who made the document.

</p>
      <p>Data on the three projects, "
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Great Men, Great Issues</emph>," "
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Meet the Humanities</emph>," and "
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Ways of Mankind</emph>," will be found in boxes 32-44. Most of the folders are geographical, as are the folders of the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Experimental discussion Project</emph> (EDP), arranged under discussion topics in boxes 44-76, which contain the evaluations of the study-discussion program materials that evolved in the Fund's Experimental discussion Project. This project helped develop liberal arts and science courses that were designed for small groups led by properly trained lay leaders who were not necessarily either professional educators or subject specialists. The study-discussion programs were conducted with experimental groups, and on the basis of criticisms received from these groups, program materials were revised and then distributed at a nominal cost to groups throughout the country. These EDP files are the rough evaluations
from which the Fund worked in revising the program materials. The story of the Experimental discussion Project is told in the report by Glen Burch, "Accent on Learning."

</p>
      <p>Boxes 77-97 contain files under the headings of 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Personal Information</emph>, 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Group Information</emph>, and 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Group Leaders' Reactions</emph>, as well as newspaper clippings, photostats, and printed material. Newsclippings and photostats are mounted
in bound volumes, rather than placed in folders. In the Fund for Adult Education Papers there is no overall report of Fund activities; the closest approximation to one is "
        
        
        
        <ref target="tcll">The Challenge of Lifetime Learning: Continuing Liberal Education, report 1955-1957</ref>," a copy of which is located in box 97. Further details on the holdings of the collection are available in the accompanying shelf list, which has been prepared from folder headings of the Fund for Adult Education Papers as they were processed prior to their arrival in the Manuscripts Division.

</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Audiorecordings</emph> consists of more than 100 audiorecordings pertaining to various projects, including "Ways of Mankind," "People Under Communism," and "Jeffersonian Heritage."</p>

There are also three folders related to the Cooperative Extension Services Project in Public Affairs and for Public Responsibilities. General files precede those of the Cooperative Extension project. These are followed by the EDP files. Within these groupings, material is arranged alphabetically.</p>
