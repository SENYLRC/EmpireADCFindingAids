     <head>Biographical History</head>
     <p>Laubach Literacy International (LLI) was founded in 1955 by Dr. Frank C. 
Laubach to help address the world-wide problem of illiteracy. Dr. Laubach 
believed that literacy was the "first step toward ending the suffering and 
exploitation of the world's disadvantaged people." The mission of Laubach 
Literacy International as stated in the 1989 annual report was "to enable 
illiterate adults and older youths to acquire the listening, speaking, 
reading, writing and mathematics skills they need to solve the problems 
they encounter in daily life; to take full advantage of opportunities in 
their environment; and to fully participate in the transformation of their 
society." LLI carried out its literacy mission both in the United States, through its  National Affiliation for Literacy Advance (NALA), and internationally, through its International Program.</p>
     <p>National Affiliation for Literacy Advance (NALA) was founded in 1968 to extend 
the work begun by Dr. Frank Laubach within the United States and Canada. In 1982 it was renamed Laubach Literacy Action (LLA).  NALA/LLA 
filled several roles including:</p>
     <blockquote>
       <p>1. Serving as a channel of communication for individuals within the field of literacy education.</p>
       <p>2. Offering workshops to train both professional and volunteer tutors to  teach reading and writing skills to native speakers of English (NSE); to teach English conversation, reading and writing skills to uneducated speakers of other languages; and to write high interest simplified reading materials for both youths and adults.
</p>
       <p>3. Aiding in the development and acquisition of material required to fill specific local needs.
</p>
       <p>4. Providing guidance on establishing literacy programs in areas of administration, finance and recruitment of students and tutors.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>New Readers Press (NRP), the publishing division of LLI, was founded in 1967 and assists in the 
development of materials used by NALA in the teaching of new readers. NRP was responsible for 
        
        
        
       <emph render="italic">Be Informed</emph>, 
        
        
        
       <emph render="italic">Laubach Way to English</emph>, and 
        
        
        
       <emph render="italic">New Streamlined 
English</emph>, series used in the instruction of those wishing to become literate. 

        
        
        
       <emph render="italic">New For You</emph> was a newspaper published for new readers containing easy to read 
articles on news of the day. Other publications geared toward new readers 
include a wide range of practical and interesting information.</p>
     <p>The International Program of Laubach Literacy International was an outgrowth 
of the work carried out by Dr. Frank Laubach between 1937 and 1954. During 
that period he gave technical assistance in establishing literacy programs 
throughout the world. With the founding of LLI in 1955, a channel was made 
available for promoting the opportunity for literacy throughout the world.</p>
     <p>Laubach Literacy International's commitment to the advancement of literacy 
presupposes a belief in the power of the word — spoken, heard, written and 
read" (LLI, 1986 Annual Report). The International Program stressed four areas 
in the carrying out of their mission:</p>
     <blockquote>
       <p>1. Materials Development: Literacy primers to be used by volunteer tutors 
were written, field tested, published and distributed. Follow-up readers were 
published for use by new readers.
</p>
       <p>2. Training: Training workshops were made available to volunteer and professional 
literacy writers, tutors and program organizers. Emphasis was placed on recruiting, 
training, and supporting tutors from the indigenous population.
</p>
       <p>3. Technical Assistance: Once a program was established LLI provided consulting 
services in the areas of program organization, administration, promotion, and 
evaluation.
</p>
       <p>4. Financial Assistance: The cost of "each one teach one" programs was shared by 
the host country and LLI. The host supplied volunteers, facilities for teaching 
and storage of materials, paid personnel and monetary gifts. LLI provided funds 
to subsidize publications and to support full-time program organizers, writers 
and tutor trainers.</p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>If there was a pre-existing literacy organization LLI did not create a new 
organization requiring financial support. Through the years the "each one 
teach one" method of teaching reading has been used in 103 countries and in 
over 300 languages.</p>
     <p>In August 2002, Laubach Literacy International merged with Literacy Volunteers of America to form ProLiteracy Worldwide.</p>

documents of Laubach Literacy International. The Laubach Literacy International Records consists primarily of files 
of individuals who served in various capacities within Laubach Literacy 
International as well as files of the administrative divisions of LLI.  The collection consists of multiple accessions which have not been physically integrated, but they are listed logically in the following inventory; as a result, box numbers may skip around.</p>
     <p>Each 
individual or administrative division was treated as a sub-unit within the 
Laubach Collection, which is therefore diveded into 17 series, as follows: General files,

resources, material from various scrap books, two reading machines

           <p>A Tin Trunk Library from the 1950s, used in India's villages. 
This library contains primers in Tamil, Hindi, and English, as well as a 
few from Korea, Haiti and Liberia. The library was donated by Mrs. Leslie 
Foust of Arkansas City, Kansas to the Topeka Literacy Council. They in 
turn donated it to Laubach Literacy International. Mrs. Foust's aunt 
originally owned the library and assisted Dr. Frank Laubach as a 
missionary to India in conjunction with the Committee on World Literacy 
and Christian Literature. The holder for the library is made out of a 5 
gallon kerosene container.
