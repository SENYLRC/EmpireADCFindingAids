      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Henry Codman Potter (1834-1908)  was an American Episcopal bishop.  He served as 
		rector of Christ Church in Greensburg, Pennsylvania (1858-1859) and of St John's Church 
		in Troy, New York (1859-1866).  He was secretary of the House of Bishops (1866-1883), 
		assistant rector of Trinity Church, Boston (1866-1868), rector of Grace Church, New York 
		City (1868-1884), and in 1887 he succeeded his uncle, Horatio Potter, as bishop of the 
		Episcopal Diocese of New York.</p>
		
		<p>Potter was known for his interest in social reform 
		and in politics.  In addition to his work assisting missions on the east side of New York 
		City, which continued even after he became a bishop, he frequently assisted in settling 
		labor disputes and was outspoken in his criticism of Mayor Robert Van Wyck for his 
		affiliation with Tammany Hall.</p>
		
		<p>He was also a productive author; among his works 
		are <emph render="italic">Sisterhoods and Deaconesses at Home and Abroad</emph> (New York 
		1871); <emph render="italic">The Gates of the East, a Winter in Egypt and Syria</emph> 
		(1877); <emph render="italic">Sermons of the City</emph> (1881);

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The Henry Codman Potter Letters consist of seven outgoing items written between 1870 and 1906.  There are 
		two letters to Dewitt Miller in response to a volume he had sent containing temperance 
		sermons and a portrait of Potter's father, Alonzo Potter, also an Episcopal bishop.  The 
		second item suggests Potter's intention to deposit the sermons with the New York Public 
		Library.</p>
		<p>The miscellaneous letters refer to church business, and include an acknowledgement of 
		receipt from an unidentified bishop of $125, which Potter suggests will be used to purchase 
		a cross.  The collection also contains a note which was enclosed with a paper Potter had 
		written on "Home Life in New York City."</p>
