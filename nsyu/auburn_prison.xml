         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>The correctional facility in Auburn, New York opened in 1817.    "The Auburn System" was intended as a new (i.e. tougher) approach to prison, and included policies such as flogging, isolation, lockstep marching, striped uniforms, and rigorously enforced silence. Auburn was the first prison to turn a profit by leasing the labor of its convicts to local manufacturers (products that came out of the Auburn prison factory included nails, barrels, clothing, shoes and boots, carpets, buttons, carpenters' tools, steam engines and boilers, combs, harnesses, furniture, brooms, clocks, buckets and pails, saddle trees, wagons and sleighs, threshing equipment, rifles, and -- at one point -- silkworms and silk).   Auburn also has the dubious distinction of being the first prison to install and use the electric chair.</p><p>Women prisoners at Auburn suffered particularly dire conditions and were not exempt from physical punishment.  In the early days, women  prisoners at Auburn were relegated to the dark and airless attic; a matron was not hired until 1832, and even then the legislature refused to appropriate funds to pay.   In 1838 all women prisoners were transferred to the  new female unit opened at Sing Sing,  but they returned in 1894 when the Auburn Asylum was closed and converted to a women's prison.  The Auburn Prison for Women remained in operation from then until 1933, when a new maximum-security wing opened at Bedford Hills.</p><p>Flogging at the Auburn facility was outlawed in 1847 and convict contract labor in 1894.  In 1913 Thomas Mott Osborne, mayor of Auburn, was appointed to the newly created State Commission for Prison Reform and, after an undercover stint as an inmate, introduced numerous reforms -- including inmate self-government -- that were later adopted at many other correctional facilities.   The prison operates today as the "Auburn Correctional Facility."</p><p>[Portions of this background adapted from the brochure "Both Sides of the Wall," published by the Cayuga Museum.]</p></bioghist>
