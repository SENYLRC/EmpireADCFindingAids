		writer for a Honolulu newspaper in the 1880s, and was a professor in English and American literature 
		at the University of Notre Dame (1885-1886) and chairman of English literature at the Catholic

		was a respected teacher, and an academic painter and muralist known for historical genre including 
		scenes from Alaska and Sioux Indians of Minnesota.  He was President of the Guild of Boston Artists,

			<head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
			<p>The Charles W. Stoddard Collection consists of 38 incoming letters, written between 1868 and 1901, 
			and one photograph.  The bulk of the letters are from artist Francis D. Millet, many originating from 
			the various American and European cities in which he worked as a painter and interior designer from 
			1875 to 1901.  A friend of Henry Adams, Henry James, Mark Twain, and a number of minor figures, Millet, 
			in a series of 36 multipaged and highly personal letters, illuminates the contemporary American 
			artistic and literary scene.  In a letter from Paris (21 Feb 1877), Millet declares:</p>
			
			<blockquote><p>The most I can find time to write you in the hurry of apartment hunting is that "I want you."  
			Why don't you come up here?  We are here in a crowd.  My cousin, her two daughters and son and myself keeping
			a house a la Bohemia in a little furnished apartment.  We shall on the 15th April take a suite of rooms 
			with a studio attached and there I shall probably stay one year if nothing happens.  Won't you come up and 
			be near us?  For the moment I am very much unsettled.  I worked in American up to the very day I sailed.  
			The last job I did was to go to Hartford and paint Mark Twain's portrait.  I lived in his house two weeks 
			had a stunning time.</p></blockquote>
		<p>Two other letters to Stoddard are from the Archibishop of St. Louis, Peter Richard Kenrick, and from 
		landscape painter John La Farge.  The collection also contains a photograph of Millet.</p></scopecontent>
