      <p>The Spire collection contains material relating to William Duer, William Alexander Lord Stirling, and to the Fisher, 
		Rapalje and Wilkins families, among others.  The material was collected by Nancy Woodson Spire (Mrs. Lyman J. Spire) as one of her research interests. </p>
      <p>William Alexander, Lord Stirling (1726-1783) was an American major-general during the American Revolutionary War. 
		Serving first as a Colonel in the New Jersey militia, he eventually rose to the rank of brigadier general for the entire 
		Continental Army.  A respected tactician, he commanded forces at the battles of Long Island, Short Hills, Brandywine, 
		Germantown and Monmouth.</p>
      <p>William Duer (1743-1799) was a British-born American lawyer, developer, and speculator from New York City. He served 
		in the Continental Congress, participated in the convention that framed the New York Constitution, and was a signer of 
		the United States Articles of Confederation.  He married Catherine Alexander, daughter of William Alexander, Lord 
		Stirling, and at least one document in the collection suggests he was also acquainted with the Wilkins family (Conveyance, William Dewer [Duer?] to States [Staats] Wilkins and Ann Smythe 1830).</p>
      <p>John Fisher (dates unknown) was a lawyer and served as a Justice of the Peace for Kings County, New York; he was also involved 
		in land speculation in central New York State.</p>
      <p>Garret Rapalje (b. 1730), also spelled Gerrit or Garrit, was descended from Joris Jansen Rapalje, one of the 
		earliest settlers of New Amsterdam.  Garret's parents were George Janse Rapalje and 
		Diana (Middagh) Rapalje. He married Helena de Nyse (b. 1732), and made his living as an importer in New York City. 
		During the 1760s he was an assistant alderman of the City. During the Revolutionary War, Rapalje was a Loyalist, 
		and later left New York City for New Orleans. He and his wife had four children: Garret II, George, Anne  (b. 1762; married Jacob Wilkins, below), and Jacques. [Information taken from the New-York Historical Society http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibit/garret-rapalje-b-1730]</p>
      <p>John Wilkins Sr. (1733-1809) was born in Pennsylvania.  According to a manuscript in the collection, his 
		paternal grandfather emigrated to Pennsylvania from Wales and his maternal grandfather came from Ireland.  He 
		served as Captain in Spencer's Regiment during the American Revolution; his oldest son, John Jr. (1761-1816), 
		enlisted at sixteen as a surgeon's mate and eventually (1796) rose to the rank of Quartermaster General.  After 
		the way, Wilkins undertook several business ventures and served as a Justice of the Peace in Pennsylvania.  He 
		was married twice and (again according to his memoir in the collection) had eleven children with each of them, 
		including two "lunatick" children.</p>
      <p>Jacob Wilkins (born circa 1735) was a brass founder, grocer, and merchant of old New York.  It is likely that 
		he was related to John Wilkins but this cannot be established.  Jacob Wilkins married Hannah Betts in 1762, and they 
		had six children: John, Jacob, William, Ann, Hannah (b. 1779), and Augustus (later a physician in Louisiana). 
		He was married again in 1793, to Ann Rapalje, and they had two children, Helen D. and States (or Staats) Wilkins.  
		Ann Rapalje Wilkins later married a Charles Smith or Smyth.  </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Spire American Revolutionary War Collection</emph> consists of letters, journals, 
			account books and other documents, the bulk of which date from or relate to the American Revolution (1775-1783).  
			The material is divided into series based on the person to whom it primarily relates, though the observant 
			researcher will note that there is considerable overlap.    An 
        
        <ref target="aic">alphabetical index of correspondents</ref> is provided at the end of this finding aid.</p>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">American Revolutionary War papers</emph> (1765-1785) includes correspondence, a few fragments and 
			envelopes; an autobiographical manuscript of and by John Wilkins, Sr.; and a group of military records.  The papers represent 
			individuals from both patriot and loyalist groups.  Correspondence includes letters to Sir John Johnson and 
			Governor George Clinton.  The military records include an account book of the New York Department of the British 
			Forces, oaths of allegiance to King George and to the new republic, a muster roll of Wentworth's Volunteers, and 
			other items.</p>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">William Alexander, Lord Stirling papers</emph> (1775-1783) includes five letters from Alexander to 
			others (two to John Hancock, one to Governor George Clinton of New York, one to the "President of Congress," and one 
			to a Captain FitzRandolph).</p>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">William Duer papers</emph> (1784-1792) consists of a small amount of correspondence and a few 
			legal and financial documents.  One relates to the Scioto Land Company.</p>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">John Fisher papers</emph> (1768-1826) primarily relate to Fisher's responsibilities as Justice of 
			the Peace of Kings County.  The correspondence, approximately 100 items, is with business associates, family, and 
			public officials (including one dated 1798 to Timothy Pickering, third U.S. Secretary of State).  Legal and financial 
			records include accounts, agreements, indentures, memoranda, petitions, receipts, summonses, warrants and others.   Interesting items include an "order of bastardy" filed against Samuel Mitchell and Nelly Lewis (1795-1796) for the birth 
			of a child out of wedlock, a warrant for the arrest of Nathaniel Price for the rape of Unis Williamson (1797), and a resolution for the formation of a New York morality society "to aid magistrates in suppressing vice and immorality on the Lord's Day" (1790).</p>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Garret Rapalje papers</emph> (1667-1830) contains correspondence and legal documents, including a genealogy of the Rapalje family.   One item (Conveyance, William Dewer [Duer?] to States [Staats] Wilkins and Ann Smythe 1830) suggests a connection with William Duer.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous material</emph> (1752-1878) at the end of the collection comprises correspondence and 
			legal and financial documents.  The correspondence includes a latter from Rufus King, Massachusetts lawyer, 
			politician and diplomat.  Legal and financial documents include accounts, agreements, bills of exchange, 
			indentures, summonses, warrants and wills.  A few of the documents relate to Garret 
			Rapalje or John Fisher.  Of particular interest is a Prussian passport or travel authorization from 1836, indicating that the bearer,  one Caspar Beckschaefer, sailed from Bremen to New Orleans.</p>
