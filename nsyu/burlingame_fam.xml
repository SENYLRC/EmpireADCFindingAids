      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Three generations of the Burlingame family are represented in the papers of 
this collection. The three major historical figures in the family are discussed 
below in accordance with the amount of material present on each individual.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="italic">Anson Burlingame</emph> (1820-1870) was the son of Joel and his wife Freelove 
(Angell) Burlingame. He attended the University of Michigan and Harvard Law 
School. After marriage to Jane Cornelia Livermore, the daughter of Isaac 
Livermore, Burlingame began a promising political career in the Massachusetts 
Senate. In 1855 he was elected as a Republican to Congress where he served 
three terms. After the presidential campaign of 1860 he became minister to 
Peking in which capacity he concluded the Burlingame Treaty. He and his wife, Jane Cornelia Livermore, had three children: Edward Livermore (b. 1848), Walter Angell (b. 1852), and Gertrude (1853-?). Burlingame died 
while on a diplomatic mission to St. Petersburg, Russia in 1870.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="italic">Edward Livermore Burlingame</emph> (1848-1922), also known as E.L. Burlingame, was Jane and Anson's eldest son. 
As a young man he grew up in the Cambridge, Massachusetts area, and in 1861 
entered Harvard. When his father was appointed minister to China, young Edward 
followed him to Peking, and later Paris, Berlin, Heidelberg, and St. 
Petersburg.  In 1871 he began a career with the <emph render="italic">New York Tribune</emph>, and married 
Ella Frances Badger in the same year. He and his wife had four children: Jane (b. 1872), Frederick Anson (b, 1873), Constance (b. 1877), and William Roger (b.  1889).  Burlingame became a literary advisor to 
Charles Scribner's Sons, and in 1886 was appointed editor of the new <emph render="italic">Scribner's 
Magazine</emph>, a post he held until his resignation in 1914.</p>
      <p><emph render="italic">William Roger Burlingame</emph> (1889-1967), known as Rog or Roger, was the second son of Edward and Ella Burlingame. As a boy Roger attended Morristown School and went on to 
Harvard University, graduating from the latter in 1913. After serving with the 
American Expeditionary Force in France during World War I, he returned to America and assumed 
various posts with Charles Scribner's Sons. In 1926 he began a career as a 
free-lance writer augmented by teaching stints at Barnard and M.I.T. During the 
course of his long career, Burlingame wrote articles, essays, books, and 
short stories. He is particularly known for non-fiction works on the historical 
impact of industry and technology on American society, though he did publish 
several novels during the early part of his career. His autobiography, 
published in 1958, is entitled <emph render="italic">I Have Known Many Words</emph>.  In 1933 Roger married Angeline Whiton, known professionally as Ann Watkins, 
literary agent and president of Ann Watkins Inc. Mr. and Mrs. Burlingame died 
within a few days of each other in 1967.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Burlingame Family Papers</emph> consists of the private and public 
papers of several generations of the prominent American family. The major 
contributor to the collection is writer and historian Roger Burlingame. There 
are also small amounts of material relating to Anson, Walter A., Edward 
Livermore, and Ann Burlingame. The papers are organized in five major 
groups: Correspondence, Legal and Financial Records, Memorabilia, Organization 
Records, and Writings.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> is separated into 
incoming, family, and outgoing letters. Among the items of special interest are the letters written by Walter A. 
Burlingame describing his experiences in China while accompanying his father, 
ambassador Anson Burlingame, in 1866 and 1867. Also present are letters from 
well known authors including F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Marquand, Edith Wharton, Roald Dahl, 
Ayn Rand, Tasha Tudor, Rudyard Kipling, Archibald MacLeish, Kaye Boyle, Sidney Howard, and others.
</p><p><emph render="bold"> Legal and Financial Records</emph> contains 
documents pertinent to the-business affairs of several family members. There 
are wills, insurance policies, passports, royalty statements, and a variety of 
materials of a similar nature.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph>, dating from 1865 to 1967,
        contains items of incidental interest about the private lives of the Burlingame and related
        families. Included in this group are address books, newspaper clippings, ephemera,
        genealogical records, biographical material, and photographs. </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Organization records</emph> consist of materials related to 
Roger Burlingame's association with various organizations. Among these are the 
Century Club, the Housatonic Valley Conference, Office of War Information, and 
the United States Army.  Many of these organizations are also represented in Correspondence, above.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Writings</emph> date from 1856 to 1967, and include the
        written works of Roger, Ann, Walter, and Anson Burlingame. The bulk of this material was
        prepared by Roger Burlingame and includes articles, books, book reviews, diaries, poetry,
        short stories, and speeches. Included in this group are drafts of published and unpublished
        works as well as materials used in preparing the drafts. There is a miscellany of literary
        works and drawings done by others.</p>

          <arrangement encodinganalog="351$a">
      <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
      <p>Incoming letters are arranged alphabetically by 
the last name of the sender or by the name of the institution the sender 
represents; a small amount of incoming correspondence to Walter Burlingame is foldered separately at the end of this section. Family correspondence is arranged roughly chronologically.  Outgoing correspondence is arranged chronologically by year and 
month; a small anount of unsorted outgoing correspondence has been placed at the beginning of this section. Memorabilia is organized alphabetically by type of material.  Manuscript materials are organized 
alphabetically by the name of the organization, and subdivided by the type of 
document.  Writings are arranged alphabetically by author, 
and then by type of written work.</p>
      <p>Note that due to rearrangement of the files there is NO BOX 14.</p>
