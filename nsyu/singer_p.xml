      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Philip Singer (1925-2016) was a medical anthropologist and documentary filmmaker.</p>  
      <p>Singer was born in Ohio on April 16, 1925. Not much is known about his early and personal
        life, but he received his doctorate from Syracuse University in 1961. His dissertation,
          <emph render="italic">Hindu Holy Men: A Study in Charisma</emph>, was based on fieldwork
        among Indian ascetics (sadhus). At Syracuse, Singer was closely associated with Ernest
        Becker (1924-1974), the Pulitzer-Prize winning author of <emph render="italic">The Denial of
          Death</emph> (1973), and with Swami Agehananda Bharati (1923-1991), a Sanskrit scholar and
        Hindu monk who taught at Syracuse for more than three decades.</p> 
        <p>Singer went on to conduct long-term research among
        Hindus in British Guiana (now Guyana), on the northern coast of South America. While serving
        on the faculty at Albany Medical College (1961-67), he studied Kali Mai, a Hindu
        mother-goddess cult in rural Guyana. In 1963, he began to work intimately with Jamsie Naidoo
        (1913-1997), the leading figure in the revival of the Kali Mai tradition, which has now
        taken root in Indo-Guyanese communities in several North American cities, including New
        York, Orlando, Tampa, and Toronto. From 1967 until his retirement in 2002, Singer was
        Professor of Anthropology and Behavioral Sciences at Oakland University in Rochester,
        Michigan.</p> 
        <p>In 1974, Singer used 16mm film to document field work that he had been conducting in
        Guyana. He later used that footage to make his first film, <emph render="italic">Divine
          Madness: Trance, Dance and Healing in Guyana</emph> (1978). Over his career, he directed
        and produced more than 60 ethnographic films and other documentaries, including <emph render="italic">Medicine Woman, Medicine Man: Traditional Holistic Medicine in Middle
          America</emph> (1985), <emph render="italic">The Haitians, the Healers, and the
          Anthropologist</emph> (1997), <emph render="italic">The Last Interview of Thomas Szasz,
          M.D.</emph> (2013), and <emph render="italic">Final Participant Observation: Senior
          Cultural Anthropologists Confront Their Mortality</emph> (2016). Singer was also the
        founding partner of Traditional Healing Productions, a film production company. Philip
        Singer died in New York City in 2016 at the age of 91.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p> The <emph render="bold">Philip Singer Papers</emph> contains correspondence, journal
        articles, interviews, notes, research files, and audiovisual materials relating to Singer's
        research and films. The collection includes more than 400 audio recordings, 600 videotapes
        and recordings, and 550 DVDs. The collection has been divided into seven series.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> contains Singer's correspondence with a handful
        of recipients. The correspondence mostly pertains to Singer's work as an anthropologist and
        his films.</p>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Films</emph> contains material relating to Singer's films. Films
        with a significant amount of material are: <emph render="italic">Circo Rois</emph>
          (2005),<emph render="italic"> Complementary Health Therapies in England</emph> (1993),
          <emph render="italic">Conventional and Unconventional Practitioners of Alternative
          Medicine in the USA</emph> (1996), <emph render="italic">Final Participant Observation:
          Senior Cultural Anthropologists Confront Their Mortality</emph> (2016), <emph render="italic">The Last Interview of Thomas Szasz</emph> (2013), <emph render="italic">The Last Mattanza</emph> (1999), <emph render="italic">One of the Mad Ones</emph> (2011),
          <emph render="italic">Sicilian Women Orgasm -- Vaginal or Clitoral?</emph> (2001), and
          <emph render="italic">Traditional Healing Nigeria</emph> (1979). For each film, manuscript
        material is listed first and any recordings related to that film last. Manuscript material
        may include correspondence, interview transcripts, notes, research, reviews, and scripts.
        Recordings may include raw footage, trailers, promos, audio recordings, VHS commercial
        tapes, and DVD transfers. </p>
      <p>Note that when [Copy 1] or [Copy 2] appears after a title it is an indication that the items are identical copies.  Other items may appear to be identical based on title and format,
        but either there are small physical differences (in the DVD artwork, for example) or we are
        unable to verify that they are truly identical.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> contains clippings about Singer, and a few
        photographs of conference events and oversized commercial photographs.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Research files</emph> contains Singer's research material on topics
        related to non-traditional medicine practiced in cultures all over the world. Topics include
        alternative medicine, bee sting therapy, depression, dowsing, folk medicine, hypnosis,
        phenylketonuria (PKU), schizophrenia, shamanism, and suicide. Medical practices in Africa,
        Cuba, Guyana, Italy, and Russia are also explored within his research files. Singer also
        researched and worked with non-traditional medical practitioners such as Native American
        healer Wanita Windwalker, unorthodox psychologist Daniel DeSole, Guyana healer Jamsie
        Naidoo, and Nigerian Chief Lambo. Additionally, in this series you can find Singer's
        research material relating to depression, right-to-die, and suicide. Because of Singer's
        interest in the topics of depression and suicide, there are files regarding Mexican artist
        Frida Kahlo and her supposed suicide after suffering from serious health conditions that
        resulted in the loss of her leg. Singer also studied difficult and graphic subject matter:
        there are files relating to clitoridectomy (female circumcision) and subincision (the
        manipulation of male genitalia found in Australian native cultures). These folders contain
        graphic content which researchers may find disturbing. </p>
      <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by research topic. Within each topic, manuscript
        material is listed first followed by any recordings – not all topics have corresponding
        recordings. Recordings may include television recordings, audio recordings, filmed lectures
        or conferences, and commercial films. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Teaching files</emph> consists of Singer's lecture notes and
        research. </p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Writings</emph> is comprised of drafts, notes, and published items.
        Most of the writings are journal articles; there are a few book and film reviews that Singer
        wrote for academic journals. </p>
      <p>Finally, <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous media</emph> contains audiovisual materials that
        did not fit within the Films or Research files series. These materials cover a wide variety
        of subjects and genres. There are personal recordings of conferences and lectures; home
        recordings; television recordings; commercial recordings; and raw footage that is not
        clearly linked to a particular film. Formats range from audio cassettes, CDs, DVDs, VHS, Hi8
        tapes, MiniDVs, and USBs. There is also a single U-matic tape. </p>

                <p>A clipping included with the DVD reads: "This video explores aspects of a patient
                  in irreversible coma: the patient who is unable to be a participant; the physician
                  who must consider the situation from physiological, psychological, and ethical
                  perspectives; and the family who is often torn between these considerations and
                  their financial perspective. The cost, both emotionally and financially, of caring
                  for a comatose person is excessively high. The viewer sees the decision-making
                  process as it evolves so that, when all life-support mechanisms are stopped, there
                  is no lingering doubt or guilt among those involved. Color, sound, editing, and
                  cinematography are of high quality. This excellent teaching video is highly
                  recommended for students and practitioners in the health care professions, and for
                  general audiences of high school age and above." - A.R. Davis, U.S. Public Health

                  called Espinazo, Nuevo Leon, had thousands of followers, whom, still living,
                  already gave him the status of a miraculous saint; an exceptional human being, a
                  God-sent for treatment and comfort. When Fidencio died, in 1938, a growing
                  religion began to form, that with time, expanded and gained strength. Nowadays,
                  there are thousands of fidencistas scattered around the country." </p>

                <p>Description on DVD reads, "Thomas Szasz, M.D. famously challenged modern
                  psychiatry in his book The Myth of Mental Illness, saying that the profession was
                  largely pseudoscience. In this edited interview, recorded just two years before
                  his death, he discusses the intellectual foundations of his theories, and why
                  these theories are so threatening to the psychiatric establishment. In addition,
                  he himself is challenged by Dr. Singer, the interviewer, to back his controversial
                  claims." </p>

            <p>Label on case of tape reads: "This videotape by Medical Anthropologist Philip Singer and Technical Consultant and Professor of Film and Motion Picture Sound, Thomas Peterson is the only effort by an anthropologist not only to describe cultural behavior, but to 'confront' it as well. Professor Singer believes that anthropologists need to squarely look at whether or not some so-called shamans and alternative healers are frauds. This research was performed during a demonstration of alleged 'psychic surgery' by a Philippine shaman in the Kettering Magnetics Laboratory at Oakland University in September, 1986." </p>

            <p>There is a long description of the tape's contents on tape sleeve. It reads: "Taken
              from sessions held at the 1972 convention of the American Association for the
              Advancement of Science, in Washington, D.C. The Parapsychological Association, a
              branch of the AAAS, focuses attention upon the processes that are involved in
              researching parapsychology. Dr. Robert L. Van De Castile, director of the Dream
              Laboratory, University of Virginia, discusses the integration of magic and ritual in
              primitive societies and our own. Robert L. Morris, research co-ordinator of the
              Psychical Research Foundation in Durham, N.C., describes the terms related to
              Parapsychology. Another participant, Dr. R. Stanford, research associate in the
              Division of Parapsychology at the University of Virginia, everyday situations, and
              suggests that we are usually unaware that such processes are taking place."</p>

            <p>A full description of contents on tape sleeve reads: "Anthropologist Dr. Margaret
              Mead is heard speaking at a press conference during the convention of the American
              Association for the Advancement of Science. Dr. Mead is associated with the American
              Museum of Natural History and is president of the General Systems Research which is
              attempting to find new ways of organizing thought in relation to the world. Also heard
              at a press conference is Dr. Rene Dubos, author of Only One Earth - The Care and
              Maintenance of a Small Planet. Dr. Dubos is a microbiologist, and environmental
              pathologist, and a scientific humanist. Drs. Mead and Dubos offer contrasting views on
              the environmental situation, commenting on present realities and future
              possibilities." </p>
