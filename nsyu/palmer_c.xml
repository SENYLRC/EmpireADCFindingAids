			<head>Biographical History</head>
			<p> <emph render="bold">CHRISTOPHER PALMER (1946-1995)</emph><lb/> by Patrick Russ</p><p> Christopher Palmer was born September 9, 1946 in Norfolk, England. As a young boy, Palmer gained an appreciation for film music while listening with his father to BBC broadcasts. He pursued keyboard studies in Saxlingham as church organist, as his father had done.

</p><p>Following graduation from Cambridge University with a joint degree in linguistics 
and music, he initially embarked on a writing career which brought him in contact with 
many film music composers in Great Britain and America. He first visited Hollywood at the 
invitation of Miklos Rozsa, who had been impressed by Palmer's critique of his work. At 
Rozsa's suggestion, he tried his hand at orchestrating part of Rozsa's score for the film 
<emph render="italic">Last Embrace</emph>. Palmer's combination of intellect and brilliant 
musical instinct allowed him quick mastery of the craft. Shortly afterwards, Elmer 
Bernstein also used Palmer to orchestrate his score for 
<emph render="italic">Heavy Metal</emph> and thus began another lifelong collaboration.

</p><p>In addition to Rozsa and Bernstein, Palmer maintained long working relationships 
with Bernard Herrmann (<emph render="italic">Taxi Driver</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Obsession</emph>), Maurice Jarre (<emph render="italic">Passage to India</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</emph>), Stanley Myers 
(<emph render="italic">The Witches</emph>), Dimitri Tiomkin (<emph render="italic">Tchaikovsky</emph>), 
and many others in over one hundred films, establishing himself as arguably the finest symphonic 
orchestrator of his generation. He also served as musical director for Milos Forman's 
<emph render="italic">Valmont</emph>. These career partnerships benefited the current 
film world, for through his frequent use of musical assistants Palmer tutored the 
future orchestrators of several contemporary film composers.

</p><p>Palmer brought to public attention film music from Hollywood's Golden Age through 
symphonic suites and dozens of film music recordings. His tireless efforts have introduced 
a new generation to memorable scores of Sir Malcolm Arnold, William Alwyn, Sir Arthur 
Bliss, George Gershwin, Bronislau Kaper, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Jerome Moross, Alfred 
Newman, Alex North, Conrad Salinger, Max Steiner, Dimitri Tiomkin, Sir William Walton, 
Franz Waxman, and Roy Webb. Among his last recordings was Elmer Bernstein's original 
score to <emph render="italic">The Magnificent Seven</emph>, never before released on 
disc, which received Germany's 1994 Echo Award for Best Soundtrack.

</p><p>Throughout his life, Palmer's masterful reconstructions of classical works by 
Debussy, Puccini, Vaughan Williams and Walton resulted in the resurrection of important 
symphonic works otherwise likely lost. Jose Carreras, James Galway and Julian Lloyd 
Webber join a long list of world-renowned performers who have recorded his arrangements.

</p><p>A prolific writer, Palmer often produced a full biography or analysis of major 
compositions of each composer he researched. He leaves behind a substantial body of 
publications including <emph render="italic">The Composer in Hollywood</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">The Britten Companion</emph>, biographies of Bliss, Delius, 
George Dyson, Herbert Howells, Prokofiev, Ravel, Rozsa, Szymanowski, Tiomkin, and an 
English translation of Milhaud's autobiography <emph render="italic">Notes Without Music</emph>, 
which includes an additional chapter by Palmer. He also edited works of nonmusical literary 
figures such as poet James Farrar and novelist Arthur Machen.


</p><p>Christopher Palmer was widely respected throughout the music community. A consummate 
musician, his multifaceted career incorporated symphonic orchestration, recording, writing, 
and lecturing for a 25 year period until his death on January 22, 1995 from an AIDS-related 
illness at age 48.

</p><p>During the last days of his life, when a weakening Christopher could talk very little, 
and finally could respond only by locking eye contact, one of his daily visitors was Elmer 
Bernstein, who figured so prominently throughout Palmer's working life. "I was with 
Christopher at the beginning of his career," remarked a saddened Elmer. "It's only fitting 
that I be there at the end." As providence would have it, Elmer was not allowed to be there 
at the end, but instead had to fly to Berlin to conduct a recording of Christopher's 
orchestrations of Franz Waxman's scores for <emph render="italic">Sayonara</emph> and 
<emph render="italic">A Place in the Sun: A Scenario For Orchestra</emph>."

</p><p>Temperamental but unfailingly loyal, possessing keen wit and remarkable insight, 
restless to pursue each path as far as it might lead, Christopher's loss will be strongly 
felt by his many friends and colleagues. </p>
		<p> <emph render="bold"> ROY WEBB (1888-1982)</emph><lb/>  (Based on the Roy Webb 
		chapter in <emph render="italic">The Composer in Hollywood</emph>, c1990 Christopher 
		Palmer)</p><p> Roy Webb composed music for and was associated with over 300 motion 
		pictures, primarily for the RKO Radio Pictures studio in Hollywood, California.

</p><p>Born in New York City in 1888, Webb as a young boy was introduced to the Metropolitan 
Opera by his mother, and to Gilbert and Sullivan operettas by his uncle. Webb also studied 
drawing and painting at the Art Students' League in New York for five years, and after 
high school he studied classical music at Columbia University. His true interest, though, 
was in lighter contemporary music and Webb and his brother Kenneth produced several 
Varsity shows, with Roy writing, arranging and conducting the music.

</p><p>While still a student at Columbia, Webb was invited by conductor Herbert Stothart 
to work on the production of Wildflower. The show was Webb's first professional job and 
marked his Broadway debut. Soon after, Webb became an artistic director at the New York 
Players' Studio, and Victor Baravalle engaged him to conduct 
<emph render="italic">Stepping Stones</emph>, a musical by Fred Stone, which ran in New 
York and on tour for two and a half years.

</p><p>Baravalle then became Musical Director at RKO (known then as Radio Pictures) and 
in 1929 invited Webb to Hollywood to orchestrate the score for the film Rio Rita. Webb 
stayed on and spent nearly his entire career at RKO as a musical director until the 
studio closed in 1955, and was sold to Desilu television. Among the many notable RKO 
films of various genres Webb composed music for are 
<emph render="italic">Bringing Up Baby</emph>, <emph render="italic">Crossfire</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Enchanted Cottage</emph>, <emph render="italic">I Remember Mama</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Kitty Foyle</emph>, <emph render="italic">Last Days of Pompeii</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Mighty Joe Young</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Rachel and the Stranger</emph>.

</p><p>Webb's forte, however, was writing for the film noir genre, a specialty at RKO 
studios, namely the gangster (<emph render="italic">Dick Tracy</emph>), thriller 
(<emph render="italic">Farewell My Lovely</emph>, <emph render="italic">Notorious</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">The Window</emph>), and horror (<emph render="italic">The Body Snatcher</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Cat People</emph>, <emph render="italic">I Walked With a Zombie</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">The Leopard Man</emph>) films.

</p><p>After RKO ceased production, Webb continued to write music scores on a freelance 
basis including <emph render="italic">Blood Alley</emph> and <emph render="italic">Sea Chase</emph> 
for Warner Bros. studios. His last major motion picture score was for the acclaimed 
1955 Paddy Chayevsky screenplay <emph render="italic">Marty</emph>. Webb also wrote music 
for television programs such as <emph render="italic">Wagon Train</emph> and 
<emph render="italic">Shirley Temple Story Book</emph>.

</p><p>In 1961 the house in which Webb and his wife Jean lived was destroyed by fire, and 
many original documents 
of his compositions were lost. However, copies of most of his film scores are preserved 
in the RKO Archives housed 
at the University of California, Los Angeles.

</p><p>Webb died in 1982 in a Santa Monica hospital at the age of 94. </p></bioghist>
