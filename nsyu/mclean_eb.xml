      <p>Edward "Ned" Beale McLean (1889-1941) was an American newspaper publisher and owner of 
		the <emph render="italic">Washington Post</emph>, inherited from his father, from 1916 to 
		1933.  McLean's ownership of the paper came after a court battle to overturn his father's 
		will.  His other ventures included thoroughbred horse racing, and he was for a time owner 
		of the Hope Diamond.  He was declared legally insane in 1933 and eventually died at 
		Sheppard-Pratt Sanitarium in Towson, Maryland.</p></bioghist>
      
      <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Edward B. McLean Papers</emph> consists of correspondence, 
			financial material, and memorabilia.</p>
			
			<p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph>, primarily personal in nature, spans more 
			than 30 years and is entirely incoming.   Topics include the purchase of boats, horses, 
			clothing, etc.; bets placed; letters from political figures regarding editorials 
			published in the Washington Post; offers of collectibles; and so on.  There are three or 
			four letters from Mrs. McLean (Evalyn Walsh McLean, 1886-1947) relating to sale of some 
			property known as Clonmel, dating from June and July of 1910.</p>
			
			<p>Among the correspondence are some items of particular interest.  There is a letter (8 
			Feb 1909)  from John Hunkey [?], expressing his distress on hearing that McLean and his 
			wife intended to become Catholics; the letter is accompanied by Hunkey's essay, "One of 
			the Reasons Why I Left an Orthodox Church."  A letter from Guy D. Goff, U.S. Senator from 
			West Virginia (19 Jan 1922) includes the text of a William McKinley memorial address 
			which Goff delivered in Niles, Ohio a few days later.</p>
			
			<p>Mrs. McLean was evidently deeply moved by the 1932 kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh, Jr.  
			 During her divorce from Edward in1934, con man Gaston Means persuaded her to give him $100,000 ostensibly to be used to recover the child; Means absconded with the money and was later convicted and sent to 
			jail.   The collection includes a letter (13 May 1934) from attorney James M. Phelan, 
			which reads in part:</p>
			
			<blockquote><p>I have made a very thorough investigation of the story of our little 
			friend and I regret to report to you that he is just somebody else trying to capitalize 
			on the tragedy...I greatly appreciate your thoughtfulness in sending him to me and can 
			readily understand why is [h]is story had such an affect [sic] on you.  He fooled me 
			until I had thoroughly investigated him...It goes back to Gaston and then washes out.</p>
			</blockquote>

      <p><emph render="bold">Financial material</emph> consists of a few receipts, some for 
		train travel, and some small pieces of paper in envelopes which may or may not represent 
		wagers placed.</p>
		
		<p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> includes a penmanship book, membership card and 
		certificate for the Congressional Country Club, a program from the 1900 Intercollegiate 
		Regatta (Universities of Columbia, Georgetown, Cornell, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), and 
		other items.</p></scopecontent>
