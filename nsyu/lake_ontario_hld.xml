         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>The Lake Ontario Shore Railroad was part of a scheme to link Portland, Maine and Boston with the west, without 
	  dependence on the New York Central Railroad.  The project was discussed as early as 1854 by Boston businessmen and 
	  was revived after the Civil War by promoters in Oswego, New York.  In March 1868, the Lake Ontario Shore Railroad 
	  Company was chartered with Gerrit Smith as its president.  It was to build westward from Oswego to Lewiston, 
	  with the expectation that other promoters would develop the remainder of the intended transcontinental linkages.</p>
	  
	  <p>The railroad was originally to be funded by private investors but when that proved impossible towns were 
	  induced to buy bonds.  In 1870 the company began to lay track and the first train ran on them in 1872.  The 
	  road was intended to be about 155 miles, but by 1873 only 51 miles had been laid.  Four trains daily ran on this 
	  stretch, between Oswego and Ontario Village in Wayne County.  The remainder of the route was still under construction.</p>
	  
	  <p>The Panic of 1873 forced the mortgage bonds of the railroad to be foreclosed and in 1874 the Lake Ontario Shore 
	  Railroad went into receivership.  it was soon reorganized, but continuing financial problems forced it to combine 
	  with the Rome, Watertown and Ogdenxsburgh Railroad in February of 1875.  That railroad, under the name of the Rome, 
	  Watertown and Oswego Railroad, was in turn merged with the New  York Central in 1891.</p>
	  
	  <p>Henry L. Davis was the secretary of the Lake Ontario Shore Railroad from its founding until 1874.  He was also 
	  the city clerk of Oswego for six years.</p></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Lake Ontario Shore Railroad and Henry L. Davis Papers</emph> consists of subject files 
		 containing legal records, financial records, correspondence, and some printed material relating to the regional New 
		 York railroad and to its long-time secretary, Henry L. Davis.  It is probable that the company's 
		 papers were in the possession of Davis and were saved with his personal papers.  In the collection is a note written on 
		 one of the company's envelopes which supports this theory:  "These papers are probably of no further use, but are saved 
		 for fear they may be wanted.  July 1875."</p>
		 
		 <p>The papers contain little information on day-to-day operations, concentrating as they do on financial aspects.  As such, 
		 they do present a fairly detailed picture of how a small regional railroad such as the Lake Ontario Shore was funded in 
		 the 1860s and 1870s.</p>
