      <p>William Douglas O'Connor (1832-1889) was an American journalist, author, civil servant, 
		and friend of poet Walt Whitman.  He began his government career as a corresponding clerk 
		with the United States Light-House Board and eventually rose to the position of  Assistant 
		General Superintendent of the Life-Saving Service.  His 
		<emph render="italic">Annual  Reports</emph> to Congress were not the usual dry government 
		documents; they were in fact such vivid,  lively narratives that "the demand for the volumes 
		became so great that large editions were necessary to meet it."  A compilation entitled 
		<emph render="italic">Heroes of the Storm</emph> was published in 1904.  When Congress 
		proposed transferring the Life-Saving Service from the Treasury to the Navy, O'Connor wrote 
		eloquently opposing it.</p><p>[Partially adapted from Timothy Harrison's article, "William 
		D. O'Connor - An American Legend," published in <extref href="http://www.lighthousedepot.com/lite_digest.asp">Lighthouse Digest</extref>, 
		June 2009.</p></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">William Douglas O'Connor Letter</emph> consists of a letter and a 
			partial manuscript.</p><p>The letter is a 50-page handwritten letter, unsigned and undated, 
			from O'Connor to the Honorable Charles J. Folger, Secretary of the Treasury.  The letter 
			protests the recimmendation of the Secretary of the Navy that the Life-Saving Service (as 
			part of the Revenue Marine) by removed from the Treasury Department and put under the Navy.  
			Although undated, the letter must have been written between 1881 and 1884 while Folger was Secretary of the Treasury.  </p><p>In closing, O'Connor writes that the experience and activities of the Life-Saving Service 
			are</p>
			<blockquote><p>entirely foreign to the knowledge or habits of employment of the personnel 
			of frigates, into whose hands, however, in the event of transfer to the Navy, the stations 
			and station work would inevitably fall.  The result would also be inevitable.  Shorn of the 
			veteran surfing science and life-saving knowledge and experience of the present race of 
			beachmen, the Life-Saving Service would suffer a sea change into a nondescript condition, 
			the immediate prelude to decadence and ruin.</p></blockquote>
			
			<p>Following this is an incomplete ten-page manuscript, marked as pages 76-86, describing a 
			visit made in the winter of 1877 to one of the stations of the Life-Saving Service.  The 
			town, the station, and the men are described, but the station is not named.  The account 
			ends with part of a description of the "brave keeper" referred to in the beginning having 
			laid down his life in the performance of his duty.  The document may have been part of a draft for 
			one O'Connor's <emph render="italic">Annual Reports</emph>.</p>
