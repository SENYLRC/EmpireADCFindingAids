      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Carey Orr (1890-1967) was a Pulitzer prize winning American editorial cartoonist. </p>
      <p>Born in Ada, Ohio on January 17 1890, Carey Cassius Orr later moved to Spokane, Washington to live with his father. As a teenager, he took a correspondence course in cartooning. But following high school, Orr studied math and engineering at his father’s urging. Orr went on to find success as a semi-professional baseball pitcher and used his earnings to study at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. </p>
      <p>Orr worked briefly for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Chicago Examiner</emph> and also as editorial cartoonist for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Nashville Tennessean</emph> from 1912 to 1917. While in Nashville, Orr was frequently the target of editorials by the opposition paper, the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Banner</emph> ran by Major E.B. Stahlman. Orr's work also appeared in 
        
        <emph render="italic">Literary Digest </emph>and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Cartoons Magazine</emph>. In 1917, Orr returned to Chicago as an editorial cartoonist for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Chicago Tribune</emph>, filling in for John T. McCutcheon. Orr created the "Tiny Tribune" strip that appeared in the paper; each of the four panels caricatured a section of the paper. Eventually, Orr replaced John T. McCutcheon. </p>
      <p>Orr received the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1961 for his October 8, 1960 cartoon. He also won several awards from the Freedoms Foundation and was presented with a gold medal from the United States government for his World War I cartoons. He was also featured on the television program, 
        
        <emph render="italic">This is Your Life</emph>.  Orr also is credited with drawing the "The Kernel Cootie" strip from approximately 1919 to 1922. </p>
      <p>Orr retired from the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Chicago Tribune</emph> on January 1, 1963. He died on May 16, 1967 at Evanston Hospital. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Carey Orr Cartoons</emph> are arranged in two series and contain original editorial cartoons, colored proofs of original cartoons and scrapbooks of published cartoons. </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Cartoons</emph> (1917-1962) consists of approximately 5,314 original editorial cartoons drawn by Orr, primarily for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Chicago Tribune</emph>. Orr's work focused on local, state, national and international politics. His cartoons often feature lots of text used to label particular elements as well as signage and dialogue. From 1943 onward, for many dates, there are also photostat proofs or copies of the same cartoon that have been colored.</p>
      <p> Early works are dated with only years. Other cartoons often contain more than one date, in the form of stamps with engraver's dates and other dates possibly indicating intended publication. For the purposes of this inventory, xxx dates have been used. Original works measure 14 ½" x 17 ½" and were drawn in ink on illustration board. Photostats measure approximately 9" x 10". </p>
      <p>Please note, part of the inventory below is a detailed item-level description of cartoons from 1916-1928. Items from these years have been assigned numbers. The remaining years have been described at the box level with dates only. </p>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph> (1943-1962) series contains 17 scrapbooks of Orr's color editorial cartoons. The originals have been disassembled and foldered; one has been retained in its original form. Accompanying some scrapbooks are lists of dates with some title information and information about cartoons not represented in the scrapbooks. </p>

              <abstract>Cartoon in six panels of a man sitting in a chair reading the newspaper. 1. The man is dressed 

in a suit with a tie and lights a cigar as he smiles saying, "I'm getting along fine at the office - Good job - Good pay- I like the place." A woman 

behind him says, "That's nice." 2. He continues, "Not many men my age are doing as well as I am - hello - here is the income tax lists. . ." 3. He leans 

down as he starts to read and says, "Jones Pays $802.50 Tax - Jacobs $1,681 - Jensen $2,431.61 - Johnson $3,622.00....." 4. His clothes are now starting 

to look disheveled, and ragged with holes in the knees of his pants. He continues, " Williams 8,881.30 - Walker $17, 672.23 - Webber $24,700.00 ...." 5. 

His clothes are progressively deteriorating as he now has holes in the soles of his shoes and holes in the elbows of his jacket. He continues, " Ericson 

$38,762.00 - Edwards $62,899 - Evans $192,679.91...." 6. The man is now furious as his clothes are rags. He rips the newspaper as he screams, "That 

publicity law's gotta be repealed!"overlay: Reg. U.S. Pat. Off.; Copyright, 1925, by The Chicago Tribune."</abstract>

trying to calm the wild horse down. Standing in the foreground is "Dr. Dawes" with an enormous hypodermic labeled "Hell-Maria Brand" and "Dawes effort 

to inject 'Pep' into the Senate."Dawes (1865-1951) was Vice President from 1925-1929. Dawes was able to draw big crowds with his "Hell Maria" speeches 

denouncing the democratic candidate Robert Lafollette during the presidential campaigns. When Dawes spoke for the first time as new President of the 

Senate he began a scathing speech against filibusters. Days later Charles Warrn's name was before Senate as the nominee for Attorney General. 

Appointments usually passed with eased, but since the Teapot Dome scandal more scrutiny was given to nominees. While Dawes was sleeping the Republicans 

pushed through a vote. It was the first time that a cabinet member was rejected in sixty years. Preliminary doodle for cartoon on verso. Paper overlay:

after Republican Senator Charles McNary of Oregon, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Representative Gilbert N. Haugen of Iowa. It was an 

attempt to help farmers get higher prices for their goods. The bills they drafted proposed that the federal government boost agricultural prices by buying 

up surpluses at a fair price level, disposing of them on foreign markets at a loss, and recovering through a fee assessed against agricultural 

producers. It passed congress on 2/17/27, but President Coolidge vetoed it on 2/15/27 and a second bill on 5/23/28. Preliminary sketches for cartoon on

a paymaster and guard were carrying a factor payroll of $15,776 through main street of South Braintree, MA. A gang of five opened fire on them and sped 

away with the payroll. The two were mortally wounded. Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti fell into a police trap set for the Braintree murders. They 

did not fare well in the political system because of their broken English, Italians as character witnesses and not taking the stand for their own 

defense. After lengthy appeals, they were sentenced to death on April 9, 1927. However, the dignity and words of the two had turned them into powerful 

symbols of social justice for many throughout the world. The governor considered clemency for them, however, they were executed on August 23, 1927. The

Legislation: The most prominent attempts to legislate farm assistance in the 1920's was named after Republican Senator Charles McNary of Oregon, 

Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Representative Gilbert N. Haugen of Iowa. It was an attempt to help farmers get higher prices for their 

goods. The bills they drafted proposed that the federal government boost agricultural prices by buying up surpluses at a fair price level, disposing of 

them on foreign markets at a loss, and recovering through a fee assessed against agricultural producers. It passed congress on 2/17/27, but President 

Coolidge vetoed it on 2/15/27 and a second bill on 5/23/28. Preliminary sketches for cartoon on verso. " Paper overlay: Copyright, 1928, by The Chicago
