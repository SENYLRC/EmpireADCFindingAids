      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Morrie Turner (1923-2014) was a Black cartoonist and creator of the 
	  <emph render="italic">Wee Pals</emph> comic strip.</p>
      <p>Morris (Morrie) Turner was born December 11, 1923 in Oakland, California. His mother 
	  was a devout Christian who instilled these beliefs in her son. Turner started drawing 
	  cartoons in the fifth grade. Like many of his contemporaries, Turner drew newspaper 
	  cartoons during his service in World War II with the Army Air Force. </p>
      <p>Turner had no formal art training and worked as a police clerk while he also did 
	  freelance cartoons.  In 1959 his strip <emph render="italic">Dinky Fellas</emph> was 
	  picked up by the <emph render="italic">Chicago Defender</emph>, a major Black 
	  newspaper.  The strip was conceived as an all-Black <emph render="italic">Peanuts</emph>,
	  though by the end of its run Turner had introduced several white characters.</p>
	  <p>In 1964 Turner devoted himself full time to drawing comic strips. "I'd been critical 
	  of the major metropolitan newspapers for not having anything but whites reflected in 
	  their cartoon strips," he once told an interviewer. "So I decided to make myself right 
	  before I popped off anymore."  Turner's <emph render="italic">Wee Pals</emph> 
	  first appeared on February 15, 1965 with the Register and Tribune Syndicate, but due 
	  to racial tensions in the United States at the time it only ran in five major newspapers. According 
	  to the Creator's Syndicate, "Within three months of [Martin Luther] King's death, the 
	  strip was appearing in over 100 newspapers nationwide." </p>
      <p><emph render="italic">Wee Pals</emph> was unusual at the time, as it featured a 
	  group of children of varying ethnicities and, later, disabilities. 
	  The strip led to an ABC Saturday morning Rankin-Bass animated show, 
        <emph render="italic">Kid Power</emph>, which premiered September 16, 1972.  Turner 
		took his message of harmony and acceptance to larger audiences through writing 
		and illustrating children's books on topics including African-American history, 
		racism, deafness and drugs. <emph render="italic">Wee Pals</emph> has also been 
		adapted into a play. Turner regularly lectured and visited inner city school children, 
		teaching and talking about cartooning. </p>
      <p>Turner received numerous awards for his work and commitment to diversity. He 
	 was honored with the California Black Chamber of Commerce Lifetime Achievement 
	  Award and the Anti-Defamation League's Humanitarian Award. The American Red Cross 
	  and Boys and Girls Clubs have also acknowledged his contributions. The Cartoon Art 
	  Museum presented Turner with the Sparky Award in 2000. The National Cartoonists 
	  Society recognized Turner's unique and groundbreaking work in 2003, awarding him the 
	  Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award. </p>
      <p>Turner continued to draw <emph render="italic">Wee Pals</emph> until his death 
	  in 2014.</p>
