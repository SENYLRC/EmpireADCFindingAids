         <p>Captain William Jay Roberts (1836-1870) of New Milford, Litchfield County, Connecticut
            was an American soldier and an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
            He studied Law at Yale and was admitted to the bar in Litchfield County in 1866 but
            never practiced due to his health. In 1861, he organized the enlistment of volunteers
            for the Union Army and served himself in the 8th Regiment of the Connecticut Volunteers
            as First Lieutenant. On May 1862 he was promoted to the rank of Captain. On January 31,
            1865 he was discharged for disability reasons due to wounds he had received at Fort
            Harrison. He died five years later at the age of 34. His wife Ann Eliza Roberts
            (1839-1920) outlived him by several decades. William's sister Jennette (d. 1854)
            attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in South Hadley, MA.</p> 
         <p>George B. Wentworth (1820-1902) served as a Union soldier in the 22nd Regiment of the Connecticut Volunteers
            during the Civil War. He was married to Comfort W. (Fisher) Wentworth. Their son Daniel
            (1850-1934) became a landscape and animal painter, and married Sarah O. Cooley in 1874.
            Daniel and Sarah went to Munich, Bavaria in 1884-1885 where Daniel studied painting. A
            letter of Sarah Wentworth to her mother-in-law Comfort Wentworth mentions Roberts' wife
            Ann Eliza and a census of 1940 lists Ann Eliza's and William's daughter Caroline Eliza
            Roberts as living in the household of Gilbert Wentworth (son of Sarah and Daniel
            Wentworth) in Syracuse, N.Y.</p></bioghist>

            as well as by the painter Daniel F. Wentworth, George Wentworth's son, while he and his
