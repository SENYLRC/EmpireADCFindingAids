      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Frederic W. Goudy (1865-1947) was an American printer and type designer of more than 120 
		fonts, among them Copperplate Gothic, Kennerley, and Goudy Old Style.  Frederic's wife Bertha M. Goudy worked closely with him and was a noted graphic designer 
		in her own right.  Both Frederic and Bertha were self-taught.</p>
      <p>With Will H. Ransom, 
		Goudy founded the Village Press in 1903, an Arts and Crafts venture similar to those of 
		William Morris in England.  In addition to his independent work Goudy was the art director for Lanston 
		Monotype for more than twenty-five years (1920-1947).  In 1940 Goudy was appointed a lecturer at Syracuse University's School of Journalism; today Fine Arts students at SU have access to the Frederic W. Goudy Typographic Laboratory and its three letter presses.  Goudy's studio at Marlborough-on-Hudson, 
		a converted mill he christened Deepdene, was the site of an annual "pilgrimage" by typographers as well as the 
		namesake for Goudy's Deepdene typeface. </p><p>David M. Norton (1923- )  is an American printer.  A graduate of Syracuse University, he has worked for Martin Merz &amp; Son, printers and bookbinders of Jamesville, New York, and for the Graphic Arts Department at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Journalism.</p>

      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">David M. Norton Collection on Frederic W. Goudy</emph> consists of printed material, memorabilia and a small amount of metal type.</p><p><emph render="bold">Printed material</emph> consists of a wide range of broadsides and specimen sheets, all in various Goudy typefaces, most printed by David Norton at the Frederic W. Goudy Typographic Laboratory
at Syracuse University's School of Journalism.  The content of the broadsides is primarily quotations, including at least one from Goudy, but there are also speech excerpts and a copy of the Hippocratic Oath.</p><p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> contains articles and clippings about Goudy and his work, three oversize portraits of Goudy, a type design poster, and a plaster relief of Goudy and his wife.  The type design poster is three-dimensional and shows the various steps in designing and cutting a typeface.</p><p>Two small sets of <emph render="bold">Type</emph> complete the collection.  One is a set of decorations designed and cut by Goudy, and which may be the only extant set, and other box contains three lines of type for the "Village Press" title banner.</p>
