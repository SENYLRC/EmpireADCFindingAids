      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Jay N. "Ding" Darling (1876-1962) was an American editorial cartoonist, wild life artist and conservationist.  </p>
      <p>Born on October 21, 1876, Jay Norwood Darling grew up in Michigan and Indiana before his family moved to Sioux City, Iowa. As a child, Darling was interesting in drawing and art but did not consider it for a career. Darling spent a year at Yankton College in South Dakota (1894) and enrolled at Beloit College the following year where he drew caricatures for the college yearbook.  Darling left Beloit but returned to graduate in 1900. </p>
      <p>Darling worked at the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Sioux City Journal</emph> for six years as a reporter and he also drew caricatures and cartoons for the paper. In 1906, Darling took a job with the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Des Moines Register and Leader</emph> where he had more artistic freedom.  He spent two years in New York City pursuing syndicated cartooning but returned to the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Des Moines Register and Leader</emph> in 1913. After another stint in New York City, he returned yet again to the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Des Moines Register and Leader</emph> in 1936 and retired in 1949.</p>
      <p>A prolific cartoonist, Darling won a Pulitzer Prize in 1924 for his 

cartoon “In Good Old USA” and again in 1943 for his cartoon “What a Place for a Waste Paper Salvage Campaign”. He was also a strong proponent of conservation and helped found the Cooperative Wildlife Research Center at Iowa State University. He studied the migration of waterfowl and through an appointment by President Franklin D. Roosevelt served  for a brief period as the  chief of the U.S. Biological Survey.  In this role, he helped to expand the nation's wildlife refuge system and was instrumental in starting the Duck 

Stamp program.  He also helped establish the National Wildlife Federation and was elected its president in 1936. </p>
      <p> Jay N. "Ding" Darling suffered a stroke in 1961 which left him partially paralyzed and he died on February 12, 1962. His conservation work is remembered through the J.N. Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island, Florida which was established in 1965.</p>
