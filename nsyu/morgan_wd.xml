      <p>William Duane Morgan (1817-1887) was an American newspaper editor and politician. He was born to a prominent family in Washington County, Pennsylvania and later moved to Ohio. He was an active member of the Democratic Party and had a stake in various  newspapers throughout his life. In 1837, he and his brother, Thomas Jefferson Morgan, were both owner/editors of <emph render="italic">Our Country</emph>, a democratic newspaper in Washington, Pennsylvania. Later, Morgan moved to Ohio where he owned the <emph render="italic">Ohio Patriot</emph> of New Lisbon from  approximately 1840 to 1871 and the <emph render="italic">Newark Advocate</emph> of Newark from 1856 to 1880. He was also the Auditor of the State of Ohio from 1852 to 1856.  </p></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         
      <p>The <emph render="bold">William Duane Morgan Correspondence</emph> consists of letters written to or about William Duane Morgan between 1836 and 1840. Morgan  arranged the letters into three packages based on their subject matter. </p><p>The first set of correspondence contains letters of recommendation written for Morgan in 1837-1838 while he was applying for the position of clerk in the Post Office of Washington County, Pennsylvania. </p><p>The second set, also from 1837-1838, consists of correspondence sent to Morgan from various newspaper owners  who were interested in selling their businesses to him. The bulk of this correspondence is  from Daniel Blocher, owner of the <emph render="italic">Maryland Advocate</emph> of Cumberland, Maryland. </p><p>The third set consists of political correspondence received by Morgan from the Democratic Party's Central Committees of Pennsylvania (1836) and Ohio (1838-1840). The bulk of this correspondence is concerned with the 1840 Ohio gubernatorial election between the incumbent Democrat Wilson Shannon and the Whig candidate Thomas Corwin. It includes a number of printed circulars mailed by the Democratic Party Committees of Pennsylvania and Ohio, which contain details of their election strategies.</p></scopecontent>
