         <p> Philippa Duke Schuyler (1931-1967) was an African-American pianist,
            composer, journalist and author.  Her father George Schuyler was also a noted playwright and journalist.</p><p>Philippa Schuyler was born on August 2nd, 1931 to Josephine Cogdell Schuyler and
            George S. Schuyler. Josephine was a white Texan from a ranching and banking family and
            George Schuyler was a highly esteemed black journalist. Philippa, therefore, was of
            mixed race. Josephine was extraordinarily attentive to Philippa’s education and Philippa showed
            herself to be remarkably gifted. At two years old, Philippa was featured in
            New York newspapers for her exceptional spelling abilities. By the age of four, Philippa was a
            noted pianist playing public recitals and radio broadcasts, usually playing some of  her own
            well-received compositions. At age eight, her IQ was tested to be 185. The media had
            branded her a child prodigy. </p>
         <p>Her parents, particularly Josephine, eschewed terms like prodigy or genius for their
            daughter and instead attributed Philippa’s exceptional talents to a diet of raw food and a "careful education." Josephine was quoted by the New
            York Herald Tribune, in one of Philippa’s earliest appearances in the newspapers (August
            3, 1934), as saying "she’s not a genius or a prodigy or anything like that. It’s just
            taking pains and keeping her well." Then, a few months later in the scrapbook, Josephine
            pasted a typed report of Philippa’s development in which she complained, "People insist
            on calling you a prodigy. I think it is because that is easier to understand. " She also
            pasted a clipping about child prodigies into the scrapbook with the accompanying
            caption: "Discouraging forecasts about child prodigies, you are included, although I
            have tried to make it clear to everyone that I do not consider you a prodigy- but the
            public loves magic and the newspapers must cater to the limitations of their readers." </p>
         <p>The family lived in Harlem, New York. George spent most of Philippa's childhood
            traveling as a correspondent journalist and lecturer. As a child, Philippa had no contact with her
            mother’s family (with the exception of one of Josephine's sisters who visited Harlem
            once when Philippa was three years old). George’s family, particularly his sister
            Louise, visited regularly and were close to Philippa. Other guests of the Schuyler
            household included prominent African-American figures and other intellectuals. Philippa
            had extremely limited contact with other young children.</p>
         <p>Philippa spent very few years in schools but instead had private tutors visit the
            apartment in Harlem. These tutors, in addition to a variety of music instructors, were
            affordable for the Schuylers only with Philippa’s performance income. Having Philippa
            perform so many concerts was a point of dispute between Josephine and several of
            Philippa’s piano teachers. Those teachers argued that despite Philippa’s diligent and
            rigorous practicing schedule, the steady stream of concerts negatively affected her
            musical education by inflating her confidence and interrupting her study of technique.
            Even so, the critics lauded her performances consistently, praising her obvious propensity for music. </p>
         <p>By the time she had proven herself to be more than just a child prodigy, Philippa faced the injustice
         of racism when trying to book performances as a talented young pianist.  Throughout the 1950s, she booked tours throughout South America and Europe
         with strong audience turnouts and excellent reviews, but was consistently unable to find sponsorship 
         from white organizations in the United States.</p>
         <p>In her thirties, Philippa changed careers from exclusively being a concert pianist to
            also working as a journalist like her father. She worked for the <emph render="italic">Manchester Union
               Leader </emph>of New Hampshire and was a correspondent to Vietnam when, in 1967, she
            died in a helicopter crash near Da Nang. She was helping escort young Vietnamese orphans
            to safety when the U.S. Army helicopter low-leveled into the ocean at a very high speed.
            Philippa, the young boy who had been sitting on her lap, and twenty year old Pfc.
            Michael Elmy drowned. </p>
         <p>After Philippa’s sudden death, Josephine wrote a series of memorial poetry dedicated to
            her beloved daughter. Josephine took her own life in 1969. George Schuyler died in 1977.

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Philippa Schuyler Collection</emph> contains
            correspondence, clippings, concert programs, printed material, scrapbooks, and writings
            (including typescripts of articles, novels, and plays as well as musical
            compositions).</p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph> refer to the articles that mention or feature
            Philippa. Most of the newspaper clippings from the collection had been pasted inside
            scrapbooks but some, especially from 1954 (when Philippa toured the southern United
            States and also played in Alaska), remained loose. When necessary, deteriorated original
            clippings have been replaced with photocopies. Frequently, the Schuylers kept the
            entirety of any magazine which featured Philippa. Those magazines have been foldered
            separately from the loose clippings. </p>
         <p>
            <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> includes letters addressed to either Philippa
            or her mother, who represented Philippa as a manager. It also includes birthday cards,
            telegrams, and postcards. These have been arranged by date. More of this kind of
            material can be found pasted within the scrapbooks by Josephine.</p>
         <p><emph render="bold">Josephine Schuyler material</emph> includes the documents following
            her suicide in 1969. One of these is a photocopy of her suicide note, in which she wrote
            "I am killing myself rather than go to a New York hospital which today are crowded,
            dirty, with incompetent nurses, indifferent mercenary doctors [and] attendants from a
            Georgia chain gang." She also dictated that "the cats must go to the ASPCA with
            provision they must be put to sleep" and added a post script to George that he "had
            better marry Carolyn." This folder also includes the cremation documents and a copy of
            the death certificate. Additionally, there are invitations and programs to the memorial
            held for Josephine at the Gallery of Modern Art. Besides the material surrounding her
            death, there is a folder for Josephine's writings and a scrapbook of newspaper
            clippings she compiled while Philippa was very young. The clippings in this scrapbook
            all concern health, nutrition, child rearing, or gifted children. </p>
         <p><emph render="bold">Programs</emph> from Philippa’s concert performances have been
            arranged by date, reflecting her tour schedule and repertoire. The years between 1953
            and 1959 were bound by the Schuylers into two volumes. </p>
         <p> The bulk of the collection is comprised of scrapbooks assembled by Josephine. <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph> include the dates from 1931 to 1937, 1939 to 1946,
            1953 to 1954 and 1957 to 1959. These scrapbooks include photographs, newspaper
            clippings, and correspondence. Additionally, Josephine wrote profusely around the pasted
            material, writing notes to Philippa or generally giving context to the memorabilia.
            Philippa addressed her parents as "Jodie" (or "Jody") and "George," and frequently
            Josephine wrote in the third person, referring to "Jodie" in the scrapbooks. The
            scrapbooks were not shown to Philippa until shortly after her thirteenth birthday. </p>
         <p><emph render="bold">Writings</emph> are divided by format. Philippa wrote many articles,
            beginning in 1945 with an article about girls in Mexico called "Friends Across the
            Border" for <emph render="italic">Calling All Girls</emph>. Besides articles, Philippa
            expanded her writing career to include books, the first of which was <emph render="italic">My Adventures in Black and White</emph>, published in 1961 and
            autobiographical. African affairs obviously interested her; she wrote a play called
               <emph render="italic">Congo!</emph> besides an investigative book called <emph render="italic">Who Killed the Congo?</emph> and a fiction book, <emph render="italic">Love, Blood and Death: A novel about Kenya</emph>. </p>
         <p>The collection also has some of Philippa’s published music and manuscripts as well as a few of her notes about other pieces of music.   A full score of Philippa's first full orchestrated work, <emph render="italic">Manhattan Nocturne</emph>, is included.   It was written when she was only thirteen and  debuted at the New York Philharmonic in April of
            1945. A Mozambique composer,
            A. Gonçalves da Fonseea, dedicated his 1962 <emph render="italic">Rapsodia Portuguesa
               para Piano e Orquestra</emph> to Philippa and the original full score and parts are
            included in the collection. </p>

                     York. The original is in an envelope glued within the scrapbook that spans
                     August 2nd, 1943 to August 2nd, 1946. It says that George Schuyler’s known
                     family tree starts with a Mohawk Indian and a Madagaskan, "possibly a run away
                     from a slave ship… took name of Jameson from Indians." That couple had a
                     daughter, Letitia Jameson, who gave birth to daughter Helen with Carl
                     Leidendraught of Germany. Helen Leidendraught married a Spaniard who changed
                     his last name to Fisher and they gave birth to Eliza Jane Fisher. Eliza married
                     George Frances Schuyler and they were the parents of George Samuel Schuyler,
                     Philippa’s father.</p>
