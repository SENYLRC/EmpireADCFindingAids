      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Leonard D. Warren (1906-1992) commonly known as L.D. Warren was an American editorial cartoonist. </p>
      <p>Leonard Deakyne “L. D.” Warren was born on December 27, 1906 in Wilmington, Delaware and graduated from Camden High School in Camden, New Jersey. Warren took a job with the New Jersey <emph render="italic">Courier Post</emph> and in 1927 left for the <emph render="italic">Philadelphia Record</emph> where he drew feature, sports and editorial cartoons. Warren also worked on a strip featuring the character Penny Penguin for the Gulf Oil Corporation in the 1930s and contributed to Gulf Funny Weekly during that time. </p><p>After twenty years with the <emph render="italic">Record</emph>, Warren became the editorial cartoonist for the <emph render="italic">Cincinnati Enquirer</emph> in 1947. While at the <emph render="italic">Enquirer</emph>, his work was also syndicated through the McNaught Syndicate from 1951 to 1974. </p>
      <p>In 1954, Warren’s work was included in a cartoon exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art and exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in London. Warren's artwork also appeared with an American Association of Editorial Cartoonists show in Yugoslavia. He taught cartooning as a guest instructor at the Art Academy of Cincinnati and gave chalk talks to University of Cincinnati students. His work was used to illustrate books, magazines and brochures. </p>
      <p>Warren received several awards from the Freedoms Foundation, the National Headliner award in 1961 and was nominated for the National Cartoonists Society Reuben award three times.  The book, <emph render="italic">The World and Warren’s Cartoons</emph> was published in 1977. </p>
      <p>In 1973, Warren retired from the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Cincinnati Enquirer</emph> but continued to contribute a weekly cartoon to the newspaper. He recommended cartoonist Jim Borgman to be his replacement. </p>
      <p>L.D. Warren died on May 14, 1992. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">L. D. Warren Papers</emph> are comprised of 
        
        <emph render="bold">Cartoons</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph>. </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Cartoons</emph> make up the bulk of the collection. There are 44 original editorial cartoons drawn for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Cincinnati Enquirer</emph> from 1966 through 1968 and one reproduction of a cartoon that was published March 1, 1952. Warren’s cartoons were known to closely match the conservative views on the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Enquirer’s</emph> editorial page. These cartoons focus on national and international issues. There are no cartoons representing local affairs. The subjects depicted include the 1968 presidential election primary candidates, government spending and the Vietnam War. Worth noting is that Warren frequently used animals to represent people and concepts. </p><p>Original cartoons measure 14" x 22 1/2" with an image size of approximately 10" x 12" and were drawn with ink and crayon on textured paper. Captions appear in ink. Blue pencil was used for borders, dates and size information. Other notations appear in red pencil. </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Clippings </emph> (1966-1968) contains one folder of  articles about Warren and his work including articles featuring some of his best cartoons. The articles appeared in the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Cincinnati Enquirer </emph> and the Sunday 
        
        <emph render="italic">Cincinnati Pictorial Enquirer.</emph></p>
