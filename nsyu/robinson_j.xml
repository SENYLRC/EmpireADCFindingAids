      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Jerry Robinson (1922- ) is an American comic book artist and cartoonist. </p><p>Robinson was born in Trenton, New Jersey in 1922 and studied journalism at Columbia University. Robinson is known for his work on 
        
        <emph render="italic">Batman</emph>, which is where his career began in 1939 after meeting Bob Kane, creator of the then-new superhero.  He has been credited with creating The Joker (whether alone or with Bill Finger and Bob Kane has been disputed) and assisting in the development Batman's sidekick, Robin the Boy Wonder. </p><p>During the 1940s and 1950s, Robinson also worked on comic books for Feature Comics, Harvey Comics and Marvel. He worked on  
        
        <emph render="italic">The Green Hornet</emph> and tried his hand at an original superhero, Atoman for Spark Comics.  Robinson also ghosted on <emph render="italic">Kerry Drake</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Lone Ranger</emph>. In 1953 Robinson launched his first newspaper strip, a science fiction piece entitled 
        
        <emph render="italic">Jett Scott</emph>, which was syndicated by the 
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Herald Tribune</emph> and lasted until 1955.  He followed this with 
        
        <emph render="italic">Still Life</emph> and a Sunday page for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Daily News</emph> entitled 
        
        <emph render="italic">True Classroom Flubs and Fluffs</emph> (1964-1984).  From 1977 to 1995, Robinson also produced 
        
        <emph render="italic">Life with Robinson</emph> for the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate. </p><p>Robinson has also written and illustrated books including <emph render="italic">The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art</emph> (1974).  He has curated exhibitions in several countries and has been commissioned by the United Nations to produce exhibitions including a 2007-2008 exhibition for the 60th anniversary of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  </p><p>Robinson has been active in many professional organizations. He served as president of the National Cartoonists Society and the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists. Robinson was involved in the overseas tours NCS organized to entertain military personnel. Robinson received the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award from NCS in 2002 and received awards for  Best Comic Magazine Artist (1956), Best Special Feature (1966) and Best Syndicated Panel (1964). He founded and was president of the Cartoonists and Writer's Syndicate and was a board member for the International Museum of Cartoon Art. He has also received honors from the International Salon of Humor,  International Pavilion of Humor in Montreal and at Comic-Con International in San Diego. He has also been involved with the Society of Illustrators and the Overseas Press Club and taught cartooning at the School of Visual Arts during the 1950s. </p><p>As of 2010, Jerry Robinson operated CartoonArts International and the Cartoonists &amp; Writers Syndicate which included 550 artists from over 75 countries. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Jerry Robinson Papers</emph> are arranged in five series and contain correspondence from readers, artwork, printed material and  research material. </p><p>
        <emph render="bold">Cartoons</emph> (1953-1970) contains original artwork, sketches, clippings and proofs of Robinson's newspaper comic strips and panel cartoons 
        
        <emph render="italic">Still Life</emph> (Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate), 
        
        <emph render="italic">Jett Scott</emph> (New York Herald-Tribune) and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Flubs and Fluffs</emph> (<emph render="italic">New York Daily News</emph>). There are also preliminary pencil sketches for 
        
        <emph render="italic">Jett Scott</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Flubs and Fluffs</emph>.   Robinson's 161 completed artworks were drawn in ink. The series includes proofs produced in both color and black and white.</p><p><emph render="bold">Reader Suggestions (opened)</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="bold">Reader Suggestions (unopened)</emph> comprise the bulk of this collection. These series contain submissions by readers of 
        
        <emph render="italic">Flubs and Fluffs</emph> from 1965 to 1986. Children submitted many of these and some include drawings. One series contains letters that have been opened and the other series contains unopened letters. Some of the incoming mail appears to have was submitted in response to a newspaper advertisement offering ten dollars for the winning suggestion.</p><p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Work Files</emph> series consists of research material used by Robinson for the revised edition of his book, 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Comics: an Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art</emph> (originally published in 1974) as well as for the production of  a cartoon calendar. The material includes photocopies and mockups with notes and commentary. Of particular interest are promotional information packets for comic strips popular in the 1990s and 2000s including: 
        
        <emph render="italic">Baldo</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Cathy</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Jump Start</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Family Tree</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Garfield</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Over the Hedge</emph>. </p><p>Miscellaneous (1953-1972) contains one item of biographical material, assorted printed material and correspondence that is unrelated to the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Flubs and Fluffs</emph> submissions. </p>
