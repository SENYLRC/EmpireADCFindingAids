      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Frank C. Laubach (1884-1970) was a Christian Evangelical missionary, author, and  educator who specialized in international literacy.     Dr. Laubach recognized literacy as a "first step toward ending the 
suffering and exploitation of the world's disadvantaged" (Laubach Literacy International brochure);  he was the founder of the "Each One Teach One" literacy teaching method and of Laubach Literacy, and is credited with teaching more than 100 million people to read."</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="underline">Frank C. Laubach</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Frank Charles Laubach was born in Benton, Pennsylvania on September 2, 1884.  He studied at  Bloomsburg State College (1901), Perkiomen Prep School (1905), Princeton University (BA, 1909), and Union Theological Seminary (1913).  He was married to Effa Seely on May 15, 1912, and earned his MA (1912) and PhD (1915) from Columbia University.</p>
      <p>In 1915, Dr. Laubach and his wife went to the Philippines as Congregational missionaries with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.  He was a minister at Cagayan, and taught at Union Theological Seminary in Manila. In 1930, he began literacy work on the island of Mindanao and developed an alphabet for the Maranaws in their own Maranaw language.  This was the start of his "Each One Teach One" concept, which encouraged adults taught by the system to then volunteer their time to teach others.   From 1930 to 1970, Dr. Laubach traveled to more than one hundred countries developing literacy primers in 312 languages.  He and his literacy teams worked with missions, private agencies, governments, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Peace Corps, and UNESCO.</p>
      <p>In 1935 Dr. Laubach organized the World Literacy Committee, and in 1941 he became one of the founders of the Committee on World Literacy and Christian Literature, known as "Lit-Lit" (later Intermedia) of the National Council of Churches.  He worked with this organization until his retirement in 1954 at the age of 70.     In 1951, to facilitate cooperation with 
government and secular organizations, Dr. Laubach started World Literacy, 
Inc. (now World Education). In 1955, the year after his retirement,  he founded Laubach Literacy, Inc., a non-profit literacy organization with headquarters in Syracuse, New York.  His son, Robert, took over the presidency of LLI after Dr. Laubach's death on June 11, 1970.  Mrs. Effa Laubach died on March 29, 1973, at the age of 85; the couple are buried in the family plot in Benton, Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Dr. Laubach was a prolific writer whose books 
covered a variety of interests, including the Philippines, prayer and spiritual life, challenges to world literacy and to international technical assistance, and materials to teach adults to read (including literacy primers in 312 languages).   He  gave the impetus to the opening of literacy and journalism courses at Hartford School of Missions, Syracuse University, Asbury College, Baylor University, University of California, and more than twenty other centers across the United States.</p>
      <p>Laubach has been recognized many times for his accomplishments.     He received honorary degrees from Princeton, Columbia, Syracuse, and Temple Universities, and from Lafayette, Wooster, Muskingam, Marietta, Findlay, and Baldwin-Wallace Colleges.  
        
        <emph render="italic">Time</emph> magazine referred to him as the founder of a world-wide literacy drive.  Norman Vincent Peale, in 
        
        <emph render="italic">Look</emph>, called Laubach one of the five greatest men in the world, and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Newsweek</emph> featured him as "one of the grand men of the missionary world."  Lowell Thomas called him "the foremost teacher of our times."  On the 100th anniversary of his birth, the United 
States Postal Service honored Dr. Laubach with the issue of a commemorative 
stamp in the "Great Americans" series.</p>
      <p>Four books have been written about him: 
        
        <emph render="italic">Apostle to the Illiterates</emph>, by David 
E. Mason;
