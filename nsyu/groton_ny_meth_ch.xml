      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>The Groton and Peruville Methodist Episcopal Churches, located in Tompkins County, New York, were originally part of 
a circuit that included Peruville, McLean, East Groton, South Hill, Groton 
Village, and Lake Chapel in the Oneida Conference. The full administrative title was "Methodist Episcopal Church, Central New York Conference, Ithaca District, Groton Charge."  In later years the 
Groton and  Peruville churches were ministered to as churches with different 
ministers appointed to them and as part of a two-church charge served by one 
minister. From about 1921 both churches were served by the same 
minister. The Groton charge continued until 1966. In 1966 the Groton 
Methodist Church merged with the Groton Congregational Church and the First 
Baptist Church of Division (Groton) to form the new Groton Community Church. 
At the time the Groton Methodist charge ceased to exist it was part of the 
Ithaca District, Central New York Conference of the United Methodist Church.</p>

<p>On July 18, 1836 the first meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 
Groton Village was called into existence by Rev. L. K. Reddington and local 
preacher Justus P. Pennoyer. The first church was built in 1842; in 1853 a 
house and lot were purchased and used as a parsonage until 1899. Then a new 
parsonage was built on the church lot. A newer auditorium was completed in 
1832 and remodeled in 1899. The church was torn down after the merger with 
the two other churches in 1966.</p>

<p>The Peruville Methodist Episcopal Church began about 1835 and ended about 
1964. There is no available information about the Peruville church property 
or its history among the records of this collection.</p>

This volume has inscribed on the first page: Property of the M. E. Church.  
Record of the meeting of the Official Board, beginning with the years 1915-1916
Included in this book are Official Board meeting minutes from 1915 to 1928. 
Union services were held with the Anti Saloon League in 1916. In 1923 the 
Groton M. E. Church moved to permit Rev. E. B. Hargrave to go to Peruville 
when convenient. Particularly interesting is a letter written by the board 
to the District Superintendent Dr. V. S. Britten warning him that he was 
pressing their minister, Mr. Hargrave too much about the World Service 
campaign. Other material deals with the condition of church property, church 
membership and planning for future events.

Meetings were held almost quarterly during this time. Joint ventures 
between the Methodist, Baptist, and Congregational churches were 
mentioned in regard to youth activities and summer services. At the 
meeting May 2, 1965 a merger committee was proposed to study the 
formation of a community church (Baptist, Congregational, and Methodist). 
The last recorded Meeting was February 23, 1966 of the Groton Methodist 
Church in this record book.

The Ladies Aid Guild books traces the activities of the Ladies Aid 
Guild of the M. E. Church, Groton, New York.  The records show the 
members names, dues, and officers. Each month the group met at a 
different lady's home. Their fund raising activities included quilt 
making, chicken pie suppers, and collections at their meetings. Little 
mention is made of specific church projects or missionary activities. 
One function of the group seems to have been socialization.

The Methodist Church was built upon the concept of classes led by 
lay persons. Between circuit rider visits these classes and their 
leaders formed the unit to hold the congregation together. In the 
record book there was evidence of nine classes being conducted in 
1906-1907. Addresses, ages, attendance, collections, and a list of 
periodicals used by the classes were given. In 1907 the secretary 
Edna Conner wrote comments about the weather alongside each 
Sunday's report. In this book there was a handwritten history in 
pen of the Groton Church. It was entitled "Methodist Episcopal 
Church History from the Historical Souvenir of Groton by Mr. and 
Mr. E. M. Avery in 1899."

Quarterly conferences were given four times a year. The District

names of church elders, preachers, stewards, etc. and their activities

Using the list of pastors from 1877 to 1921 there are many instances 
when the Groton and Peruville Methodist Episcopal Churches were served 
by different preachers. It seems that around 1921 the list becomes 
almost identical so that a certain times a single pastor may have 
served both churches before 1921. These records date back to 1835 and 
include birthdates of many early members as well as their places of 
residence. Other areas covered in this book are:</p>
<p>A. Record of Pastors 1875-1888, 1911-1921<lb/>
B. Members of Full Connection<lb/>
C. Record of Probationers<lb/>
