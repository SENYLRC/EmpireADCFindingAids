      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Norman Corwin (1910-2011) was an American writer, screenwriter, producer, essayist and 
		teacher of journalism and writing.    His early radio programs included love stories, 
		satire, biography, fantasy, mystery, Bible stories, travelogues, history, media 
		analyses, philosophy, and current events.  He has been called America's "poet laureate 
		of radio."  On May 8, 1945, his one-hour live broadcast on the occasion of the end of 
		World War II, 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">On A Note of Triumph</emph>, drew 60 million listeners; poet 
		  Carl Sandburg praised it as "one of the all-time great American poems."</p>
      <p>Corwin is also the author of several books, including 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Holes In A Stained Glass Window</emph> (1978) and 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Trivializing America</emph> (1983), and his script for the 
		  movie 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Lust For Life</emph> (1957) was nominated for an Oscar. His 
		  television credits include his 1971 series "Norman Corwin Presents."  In the 1990s he 
		  began a new series of radio program for National Public Radio, whose casts have 
		  included William Shatner, Jack Lemmon, Charles Kuralt, Martin Landau, Hume Cronyn, 
		  and Charles Durning.</p>
      <p>As of 2008 Corwin was still very active in his field, writing a monthly column on media, chairing two award 
		committees for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences, and serving as a Writer in 
		Residence at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication.</p>
      <p>Corwin was recognized many times over his career for his achievements; his 
		awards include a Peabody (1941, the first year they were awarded), the One World 
		Award (1946), a duPont-Columbia Award, and an Honorary Doctorate from Lincoln College 
		(1990). He was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1993, and in 2006 a documentary 
		film on his life (
        
        <emph render="italic">A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin</emph>) won 
		  an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Feature).</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"I have no apology to make for the affirmative tone of these scripts. I am 
		  convinced we will get where we want to go. It will be grim en route, but I 
		  think there is nothing to be said for cynicism and despair, and everything to 
		  be said for getting out and working toward a better world."

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">Norman Corwin Papers</emph> includes correspondence, 
		  manuscripts, printed material, published material, photographs, and more than one hundred and forty 
		  recordings, mostly phono discs with a few reel tapes.</p>
      <p>As originally donated, many of the packets of material were in numbered envelopes with lengthy typed 
		notes affixed to the front (the author of the notes is unknown).  This information has been incorporated into the descriptions given in the inventory below.  The 
		notes often reference other envelopes by number; for this reason the numbering has been retained in the 
		folder titles given in  the inventory below.  So for example,"Guthrie, Woody (463)" indicates that the original envelope 
		was numbered "463" by the donor.  The typed descriptions have also been retained and filed in the folder, 
		with the rest of the contents.  The donor also assigned numbers to the phono disc recordings, for example LP-1, LP-2, and so on. These numbers have been retained in internal documentation, but are not included in  the inventory below. During processing, each recorded item (disc, tape reel, etc.) was assigned a unique identification number (corwin_0001, corwin_0002). Please request recordings using this number.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> consists of incoming and outgoing correspondence.  Much of 
		  the outgoing is in the form of carbons.  Correspondents include actors and actresses who appeared in 
		  Corwin's productions (Joan Crawford, Helen Hayes, Charles Laughton), friends (Elizabeth McCausland, 
		  Dorothy Norman), other writers (Stephen Vincent Benet, Dorothy Parker), agents (Cook Brothers, Leah 
		  Salisbury), and fans/admirers of his work.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> contains of a range of items representing Corwin's career.  
		  These include programs from Corwin productions, announcements of his appearances, clippings spanning 
		  nearly thirty years, a certificate from Pan American Airways for crossing the International Date Line 
		  during his One World Flight, a large scrapbook of Christmas cards received over several years, a few 
		  photographs, and more.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Productions of Corwin</emph> encompasses all media -- print, radio and film -- and 
		  therefore includes addresses, articles and books, operas, poetry, radio programs, stage plays, and much 
		  more.   Types of material for each production may include correspondence (both internal, related to 
		  production issues, and external, such as congratulatory/admiring letters and telegrams), manuscripts, 
		  final scripts, photographs, publicity, and recordings.  Not all types of material are present for every 
		  production.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Productions of others</emph> consists of scholarly or artistic output of others that 
		  is related to Corwin in some fashion.  Included here are interviews of Corwin; papers, dissertations, 
		  theses and articles about Corwin and his work; productions by others of Corwin's programs; musical or 
		  choral arrangements of his work; and more.</p>

            <p>Corwin was introduced by Senator William J. Fulbright. Also on the speaking program were Albert Einstein, Dr. A. H. Atkinson, Richard de Rochemont, and Senator Fulbright. Speeches of all five are contained on these discs.  Because of imperfect recording, at too slow a speed, the pitch of each speaker's voice is raised slightly above normal.  Believed only recorded copy of these speeches extant.</p>

This one-act opera was presented by the Metropolitan Opera Company at the Metropolitan Opera House on January 11, 1947. Max Rudolf conducted; Mack Harell sang the role of Samson, and Regina Resnik sang Delilah. Herbert Graf was in charge of stage direction and the set was designed and lit by Samuel Leve.  The script is published in the volume MORE BY CORWIN. The libretto was published separately in the GRAND OPERA series, by Fred Rullman, Inc.</p><p>Composer Rogers had earlier requested Corwin’s permission to draft the text of his verse play SAMSON, presented in 1941 an one of the 26 BY CORWIN series over CBS (non-operatic); Corwin did not participate and Rogers used the text almost verbatim. The opera was performed twice by the Met, and was received with hostility by most of the critics. The New Yorker and one or two eastern newspapers were the only exceptions to the generally unfavorable reaction.  Prior to its production by the Met, and directly contributory to it, THE WARRIOR was awarded a $1500 first prize as the most meritorious American work submitted in a competition organized by the Ditson Fund of Columbia University. the score was submitted anonymously, under the terms of the competition, and the international jury included Edward Johnson, the General Manager of the Met.</p></scopecontent><c04>

                <scopecontent><p>Broadcast from Maida Vale studios of BBC, London. Written and directed by Corwin, and produced by Edward R. Murrow in London as the sixth program of the AMERICAN IN ENGLAND series for which Corwin flew to England during the war.  The printed date on the sleeve's label is September 8, 1942, but is crossed of with a black marker. On the left side of the label is handwritten different date: Dec. 12. Joseph Julian narrated, and Betty Hardy appeared as Betty. The original score was composed by Benjamin Britten [this sentence is underlined with a blue pencil], and performed by the R.A.F. Symphony orchestra under Wing Commander R. P. O'Donnell. The script is published in UNTITLED AND OTHER RADIO DRAMAS.  Atmospheric disturbances garbled short-wave transmission during the original broadcast, and although the program was heard in Britain, it was not heard in the U.S. until Dec. 15 of the same year, when it was produced as part of the extended home-based series. For this production the role of Betty was performed by Edna Best, and music was by Lyn Murray.  </p></scopecontent><c05>

            <p>Written by Corwin for United nations Radio and first broadcast by the BBC on Oct. 4, 1955, with Sir Laurence Olivier playing the role of Frabjoy. This was one of few Corwin shows that he did not direct, and he was very unhappy with the casting of Vuz. The program was heard throughout the English-speaking world, but not in the United States. By 1955 the American networks were no longer giving "free" time to UN shows.  Unpublished.  See item #59 - script.</p>

            <p>First broadcast on March 26, 1950, over the Mutual Broadcasting System, and later carried over the national radio systems of most of the member states of the UN. It attracted particular attention in the  U.S. and Great Britain, and was widely reviewed. The script was not published in the U.S., but was produced as a book in Japan, translated by Jiro Nanye.  Corwin wrote, directed and produced the program at the instance of United Nations Radio, for which he was then Chief of Special Projects, to commemorate the anniversary of the signing of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly meeting in Paris. Most of the production was done in Hollywood; some sections came from New York.</p>

            <p>Presented over CBS on August 17, 1941, as the 15th program of the 26 By Corwin series, and the second of three programs on Biblical themes. Lyn Murray wrote an original score to a libretto by Corwin, based on the Biblical Book of Esther. Corwin regarded his contribution to it as the poorest to any musical production in his output. Martin Gable appeared in the role of Haman. Other credits, unavailable at this writing, are indicated on the disc itself. The opera enjoyed some popularity, and was done by groups theatrically around the country. The libretto is unpublished, but the lyric of the Queen and Murray's music to it were independently published as a song entitled LOVE. There is a note on the sleeve's label that additional data is in Envelope 165. On the disc's labels is printed: "For reference recording only"</p>

<scopecontent>
            <p>Adapted from Stephen Vincent Benet's epic poem, and directed and produced by Corwin over CBS on July 20, 1939. At this time an hour-long dramatization was extremely rare in radio. Corwin had been with the network a little over one year, and this was his first production from a Playhouse (on Broadway at 53rd street, New York City), and his biggest show up to that time. Ray Collins performed the role of John Brown; narrators included Frank Gallop and Everett Sloane. Due to a 10-minute timing error by a production assistant, ten minutes were cut by Corwin just before the program went on the air. the error was discovered half way through the live broadcast, with the result that Corwin was forced to drop the pace and "stretch" elements of the broadcast, in the latter half. Even with this heavy retard, the program finished some minutes under its intended hour.  Adaptation not published. Corwin's personal acquaintance with Benet did not begin until 1941.  The musical score was composed and conducted by Leith Stevens.</p>

<scopecontent>
            <p>Broadcast on March 21, 1944 as the third in the first COLUMBIA PRESENTS CORWIN series. It starred Raymond Massey, Burl Ives (singing the principal role) and Richard Huey, who played the role of the preacher in Alabama. Corwin directed but did not write the work; it was written by Millard Lampell, with music by Earl Robinson. Robinson himself was one of the cast, and called the square dance. Lyn Murray directed the orchestra and the Jeff Alexander Chorus. Unpublished. Several commercial recordings were made later, including one sung by Bing Crosby. Corwin directed the Decca recording, which consisted of the same company that appears in this disc, with the exception of Raymond Johnstone, who replaced Massey. The disc labels indicate that the recording is made for Gerald Kean.</p>

The third step was to select salient material from hours of tape on each program, and dub these onto 16-inch acetate discs such as the enclosed. Finally, from these work-cut discs ( and not from tape, as is the standard practice today) the recorded material went out on the air, integrated with Corwin's “live” narration, and music
The work cuts are in the almost every instance longer than the excerpts heard on the air. In cases where the final selection of the text to be broadcast came within on of the bands on the disc, an engineer in the control room of the broadcasting studio simply had to locate the spot and place the pickup needle on it, ready to go on cue.</p>
              <p>Because portable equipment broke down (wire recorder) studio facilities were used in some countries of this trip, including the Scandinavian. Most of these discs, being on glass bases, have been broken or lost over the years. Naturally, the usable ratio of all such interviews was very small, and particularly so when the interviewee was dull or had difficulty with the language.  </p>
				  <p>Material on these discs was recorded in Egypt, England, India, Italy, the U.S.S.R., Norway, Australia, Poland, and the Philippine Republic.  Most of the material on these discs, including interviews with figures of world renown, has never been broadcast or published in full in any form, and exists on these platters alone.</p>

            <p>This constitutes one of the last aural reports to come from within China before it fell to the Communists.

Includes material recorded in Nanking, Shanghai and Peiping; interviews with Mayor Wu of Shanghai; Minister of Information Peng Hsueh Pei; Dr. H. H. Kung, who claimed descent from Confucius; Dr. Sun Fo, son of China's first president, Sun Yat Sen; General Chou En-Lai, since very high in the Peking government; Walter Robertson, U.S. Commissioner at Executive Headquarters in Peiping (later No. 1 U.S. representative in Korea); General Chang Kai-Ming of the Nationalists; General Yeh Chien-Ying, Communist; writers, artists, etc.</p>

            <p>Address over radio station XMHA in Shanghai, China on September 2, 1946, on the eve of Corwin's departure from China for Japan, on his One World Flight journey. Corwin was invited to record an extemporaneous preface to a playing of his program "On a Note of triumph" from discs.  Corwin's comments, and the playback of the program, were the principal feature of the final day of the station's existence. XMHA was operated by the United States Army, through a unit in Shanghai, and it was closed down when this unit was phased out.  Text unpublished. Only existing copy.</p>

            <p>Statement on departure from Australia for New Zealand, in the course of Corwin's ONE WORLD FLIGHT. Dated October 4, 1946.  Included in this envelope is also a memorandum from G. E. Clay of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to "Murph" which reads: "Norman Corwin (God bless him) is leaving by flying-boat on Friday morning, about six, for N.Z. You will hardly have time to get an interview, so Cotton has had a record prepared of Corwin's farewell message to Australia. This Cotton wants used, when you announce Corwin's departure in your morning session. Just as well, of course, to check that has actually left, but if you can get Paul to do this by phone...It is only 12 seconds long, so ought to be easy  to work in."  The statement was not worth all the trouble. in addition to being only 12 seconds long, it sounds truncated. The hour of 6 referred to was AM.</p>

            <p>On December 19, 1944, Orson Welles appeared as Nero in a production of Corwin's Christmas play, sponsored by Cresta Blanca over CBS. Welles also directed.  Corwin had requested Welles to play Nero and also direct, when he sold the rights to Cresta Blanca for this production. He repented of the decision when he heard the broadcast on the opposite coast, for he felt the Welles, for whom he had (and continued to have) great admiration, hammed it up somewhat mercilessly.</p>

            <p>This broadcast, on Nov.  3, 1938, was most important to Corwin's career, for on the basis of unusually favorable reaction to it, he was given his first series - WORDS WITHOUT MUSIC, which went on the air starting one month later. It marked the first time that poetic material has been brought to radio in this manner. Although in retrospect Corwin considered his techniques crude at this early stage, they contributed to the body of experience that went into the later works. Included in the cast were George C. Coulouris, Arnold Moss, Don Costello, Luis Van Rooten, and Adelaide Klein.</p>

            <p>The first of three programs based on the writing of American literary giants. Corwin adapted poems by Carl Sandburg, drawing most heavily on THE PEOPLE, YES. Charles Laughton, who appeared in each of the three programs, performed the major work, and the score by Bernard Herrmann accompanied. This was the 14th of a series of 22 broadcasts of the firs COLUMBIA PRESENTS CORWIN sequence (there was a second in 1945) and it was presented over CBS on June 6, 1944. The adaptation has not been published. On the sleeve's label is indicated to refer to Envelope #85 for press and mail reaction. A handwritten note on the disc's label indicates that this is Corwin's copy. The printed date there is 06/08/1944, but is crossed off and in pen is written 06/06/1944.</p>

				and Andrei Gromyko of the U.S.S.R. Also Trygve Lie, Secretary General of the UN, as well as  Charles Collingwood, 
				Theodore White, William L. Shirer, Bill Downs, and Joseph C. Harsh. Corwin conceived the components and structure

            <p>Miss Waldo, who starred for many years in the radio serial CORLISS ARCHER, made her own selection of material from early Corwin broadcasts - SEEMS RADIO IS HERE TO STAY, GOOD HEAVENS, and PSALM FOR A DARK YEAR. She read these to organ accompaniment.  Corwin did not direct; he knew nothing of the reading, and was presented the record some time later. The disc was distributed among material that was circulated by the Armed Forces Radio Service during the war.  Mrs. Waldo was the wife of Robert E. Lee, co-author of INHERIT THE WIND, AUNTIE MAE, and other plays and musicals.</p>

            <p>Promotional recording for Studio One, a projected series offered for commercial sponsorship by William Hobart Weintraub, ca. 1944-5. Joseph Julian, whom Corwin  had cast as the American on AN AMERICAN IN ENGLAND in 1942, appears on this disc. Corwin's only contribution to this aural prospectus was the title. Though the series never became a reality, the title was used - with Corwin's permission - by his friend Fletcher Markle for a sustaining drama series over CBS, and later it was adopted by - and sponsored by - the Ford Motor Company. The title STUDIO ONE also moved intact over to television, where for some time it served as the name of one of the foremost dramatic programs. </p>
