      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>David Stam (1935- ) is an American librarian, scholar and author specializing in book history and polar 
		exploration, whose service to the library profession spans more than fifty years.</p>
      <p>Stam was one of seven children (brothers Paul, John, James, and Robert, and sisters Ruth and Mary). 
		He attended Wheaton College (1951-1955) where he was for a time the editor of the college paper, the 
		
        
        <emph render="italic">Wheaton Record</emph>, whose journalistic independence he fiercely defended.  
		On his father's side Stam came from a tradition of missionary work and active church involvement, 
		and following graduation he took several courses at the University of Edinburgh's Divinity School but 
		did not earn a degree.  He served a tour in the United States Navy (1956-1958) as a Journalist 2d Class, which took 
		him to (among other places) Antarctica and thereby launched a lifelong fascination with polar exploration.</p>
      <p>Upon leaving the Navy Stam went to work for the New York Public Library (1959-1964) as a clerical assistant, later becoming assistant editor 
		for library publications, reference librarian, and Manuscript Cataloger.  While at NYPL he earned his 
		Master's in Library Science from Rutgers University (1962).  In 1964 he accepted a position as Librarian at Marlboro 
		College in Marlboro, Vermont (1964-1967), where he served as Librarian and taught courses in English literature
		and printing history.  He served as Head of Technical Services and then Associate Librarian at the Newberry Library in 
		Chicago (1967-1973), and as University Librarian for Johns Hopkins University (1973-1978), during which period he earned his PhD in History 
		from Northwestern University.  He returned to the New York Public Library as Andrew W. Mellon Director of the 
		Research Libraries (1978-1986), and then served as University Librarian for Syracuse University (1986-1998).  After his retirement he was awarded the rank of Librarian Emeritus, and continuesdto write and teach.</p>
      <p>Stam has served on numerous boards and committees over the course of his career, including leadership roles with 
		the Research Libraries Group (Board of Governors, 1978-1986; Board of Directors, 1992-1998), the Independent Research 
		Libraries Association (Chairman, 1981-1986), the Associatin of Research Libraries' Preservation of Library 
		Materials (Chairman, 1975-1985), and Syracuse University Press (Board of Directors, 1992-1998).  His scholarship spanned topics as various as research library management and frostbite; his book 
		
        
        <emph render="italic">Adventures in Polar Reading: The Book Cultures of High Latitudes</emph> (Oak Knoll, 2019) 
		draws together his two lifelong passions.</p>

			printed material, subject files, and writings by Stam and others.</p>

			United States Navy, his numerous awards and recognitions, clippings about him and his work, events wherein he was the

			worked, including Johns Hopkins University, Marlboro College, the New York Public Library, and Syracuse University.
