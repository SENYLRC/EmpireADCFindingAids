      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Hanson Weightman Baldwin (1903-1991) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American author and military historian.  
		He was born March 22, 1903, in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Oliver Perry and Caroline 
		Sutton Baldwin. His father was managing editor and editorial writer for the Baltimore 
		Sun. Baldwin attended the Boys' Latin School in Baltimore and graduated from the United 
		States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1924. After serving aboard battleships and a 
		destroyer, he resigned from the Navy in 1927 and became a reporter for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Baltimore 
		Sun</emph> the following year. He joined the 
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> two days before the 1929 stock 
		market crash and was appointed its military editor in 1937.</p>
      <p>Baldwin traveled throughout Europe in the 1930's, reporting on the buildup of the 
		German war machine and the military preparedness of other European nations. Before the 
		United States entered World War II, he was invited to lecture soldiers about military 
		and political problems. His coverage of the war in the Western Pacific won him a Pulitzer 
		Prize in 1943, and he was present during many other important campaigns, including the 
		Normandy invasion. Syracuse University's School of Journalism awarded him a medal for 
		distinguished service in 1944, and he received an honorary doctorate from Drake University 
		in 1945.</p>
      <p>After the war, Baldwin concentrated on military-political problems and the organization 
		of the United States military for the atomic age. He covered atomic bomb tests, the Korean 
		conflict, the Suez crisis, and the war in Vietnam before his retirement in 1968.</p>
      <p>In addition to his work for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Times</emph>, Baldwin contributed articles to such publications 
		as 
        
        <emph render="italic">Aviation</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Foreign Affairs</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Harper's</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">National Review</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Reader's Digest</emph>, and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Saturday 
		Evening Post</emph>. He also wrote or edited nineteen books, including 
        
        <emph render="italic">United We Stand!: Defense of 
		the Western Hemisphere</emph> (1941), 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Great Arms Race: A Comparison of U.S. and Soviet Power 
		Today</emph> (1958), 
        
        <emph render="italic">World War I: An Outline History</emph> (1962), 
        
        <emph render="italic">Battles Lost and Won: Great Campaigns 
		of World War II</emph> (1966), and 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Crucial Years: 1939-1941</emph> (1976).  He wrote, but never published, a biography of John Shirley "Tiger Jack" Wood (1888-1966), an American Major General and commander of the 4th Armored Division.  Wood was a close friend of General Patton, a brilliant commander who has been called "the American Rommel." (
        
        <emph render="italic">Patton: a Genius for War</emph>, Carlo d'Este, p. 631).</p>
      <p>Baldwin married Helen Bruce of Springfield, Ohio, in 1931, and the couple had two 
		daughters. The Baldwins moved to Roxbury, Connecticut, after his retirement from the

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Hanson Baldwin Papers</emph> are entirely related to Baldwin's work on a biography of Major General John 
			Shirley Wood, concentrating on the military leader's experiences during World War II. 
			The papers consist of correspondence, manuscripts, and miscellaneous material.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> includes letters from those who 
			served with General Wood, including one from former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and correspondence with Wood's widow and son about the unsuccessful efforts to 
			find a publisher. Letters from publishers explain their reasons for rejecting the 
			manuscript; they felt there was no current market for military biographies and 
			recommended Baldwin find a small publisher specializing in military material.  Some correspondence between Baldwin and General Wood has been copied from the 
			John Shirley Wood Papers.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Manuscripts</emph> contains the final version of the manuscript for Baldwin's unpublished biography of 
			General Wood, a rough draft, and a draft fragment.  
        
        <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous</emph> contains some notes relating to the manuscript and several published items containing articles about General Wood.</p>
