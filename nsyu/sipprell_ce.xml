      </note>
      <p>Clara E. Sipprell (1885-1975) was a Canadian-American photographer known for her landscapes and portraits of famous actors, artists, writers and scientists.</p>
      <p>Sipprell was born in Ontario, Canada, a posthumous child with
                        five brothers. Her widowed mother had to work to support the family, and
                        Clara lived with her grandparents until she was old enough to go to school.
                        Henry, the next to eldest, went to Buffalo, New York, where he found work
                        and soon drew the rest of the family after him. The eldest boy, Frank,
                        became a photographer and soon had a shop of his own.</p>
      <p>Clara spent her free time in her brother's shop. At the age of sixteen she left
                        school and devoted her entire time to what was to become her life's work.
                        For ten years she assisted her brother Frank, learning photographic
                        techniques during the period of the glass plate and platinum paper. When
                        artificial lighting came into use her brother adopted it, but Clara
                        stuck to the old ways. By doing so, she was setting up her own standards and
                        establishing her own ideas of what a photograph should be. She did not use artificial lighting, believing that natural light would give the result
                        she preferred. She did not enlarge, nor did she crop her photographs to
                        manipulate her composition; implicitly the composition must be complete
                        before the picture is made. It is claimed also that she did not retouch her
                        negatives, although there is some evidence in the collection to the
                        contrary.</p>
      <p>Her early exhibitions were at the Buffalo Camera Club at a time when its
                        membership was closed to women; one year she won half the prizes offered.
                        Her first New York show was at Teachers College, Columbia University, and in 1915 she opened a studio in Greenwich Village where she shared an apartment with long-time friend Jessica Beers. The work of other
                        New York photographers taught her much, she says; Alfred Stieglitz, Edward
                        Steichen, Dr. Arnold Genthe, Max Weber, Clarence White, Gertrude Kasebier,
                        and Alice Boughton were among them. She became a member of the Pictorial
                        Photographers of America, the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain,
                        and the Arts Club of Washington.</p>
      <p>A Russian friend, Irina Khrabroff, arranged for Sipprell to photograph Stanislavsky's Moscow Art
                        Theatre troupe, the first of a number of seminal opportunities for her. A
                        trip to Vermont opened up further vistas for her, and she engaged a studio
                        in the Connecticut River Valley village of Thetford which she maintained for
                        seventeen summers. In 1923 Irina married Yugoslavian Feodor D. Cekich (alternate 
								spellings in related collections at other repositories include Zekitch and 
								Cekic), through whom Sipprell was introduced
                        to that country as a subject for her photographs. Sipprell and the Cekiches remained close friends and traveling companions for many years.  Nina, the child of this
                        marriage, was Sipprell's god-daughter and a frequent subject of her 
								photographs from birth through marriage and motherhood.   Sipprell traveled to Sweden in 1928, where her friends arranged access to the Royal Palace and the opportunity to photograph
                        King Gustav and other members of the Swedish royal family.  </p>
      <p>Many famous personalities came to her studio for portraits, including Albert
                        Einstein, Robert Frost, Edwin Markham, and Pearl Buck.   During the 1920s and 1930s, Sipprell's work was recognized in both
                        national and international exhibits which included her work in landscapes
                        and still lifes as well as portraits. One of her cityscapes, "New York-Old
                        and New", was one of the first photographs acquired by the Museum of Modern
                        Art in 1932.</p>
      <p>In 1937 Sipprell moved her Vermont summer studio from Thetford Hill
                        to Manchester Center. Shortly thereafter Sipprell met writer and librarian Phyllis Fenner, who became her housemate,  traveling companion, and close friend for the next thirty-eight years.</p>
      <p>Annual trips
                        to Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Japan, Great Britain, France, and to
                        visit friends in Yugoslavia provided new experiences and new subjects for
                        her camera. A collection of sixty photographs, which included several taken
                        as a result of these trips as well as many portraits of those whom she
                        regarded as the "great ones", was chosen for exhibition at Syracuse
                        University in 1960. Sipprell died in 1975 at the age of 89.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>
        The Clara Sipprell Papers consist of correspondence, memorabilia, negatives and proof prints, photographs, and a small amount of miscellaneous material.</p><p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> contains client
                        correspondence and a small amount of personal correspondence, including letters and research materials created by Phyllis
                        Fenner and Antje Lemke.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> includes Sipprell's photographic
                        equipment (camera, a lens, and an easel) as well as a studio brochure and business card, two taped interviews
                        with Sipprell, and an assortment of
                        personal photographs.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Negatives and proof prints</emph> comprise the bulk of the collection.   Note that a given photograph may exist in numerous different negative forms, some created by Sipprell and others created by &scrc_name; staff as part of preservation efforts.  In addition, many of
                        the negatives have been digitized and are available online.   Many are also present as prints (see 
        
        <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph>, below). To simplify locating all negatives of a person or subject, this section of the inventory lists them  in alphabetical order by name of the subject.  Children are often listed under the parents' names -- for example, "Lewar, Katherine (son)" -- and wives under the name of their husband (for example, "Smith, Mrs. John").</p>
      <p>The collection also contains two hundred and forty original 
        
        <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph>, 1915-1963, approximately eighty of which appeared in the book 
        
        <emph render="italic">Moment of light: Photographs of
                              Clara Sipprell</emph> by Elizabeth Gray Vining. These are divided into four series determined by
                        their subject matter; many are also available in various negative forms (see 
        
        <emph render="bold">Negatives and proof prints</emph>, above).</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="underline">Character studies</emph> of individuals include five prints of Nina Cekich, Miss Sipprell's
                        god-daughter, as well as one of Peter Helms, Nina's son.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="underline">Landscape studies</emph> include four subseries of United States, Canadian, Vermont,
                        and Yugoslav views.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="underline">Portrait studies</emph>, the most extensive series in the collection, represent Miss
                        Sipprell's photographs of celebrities, friends and neighbors. Items in this
                        series are listed alphabetically by the last name of the person portrayed,
                        with the exception of royalty which may be located under the given name.
                        When more than one person is portrayed in the same photograph, cross
                        references are provided.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="underline">Still life studies</emph> contains miscellaneous still lifes.</p>
      <p>Prints acquired separately  contain works by Sipprell that were donated by others and acquired separately from the rest of the collection.  The donors for each item are given in the inventory below.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous</emph> materials include articles and clippings about Sipprell, two autochromes, exhibit catalogs, a file index of
                        the Sipprell negatives created by staff at &scrc_name;, a framed negative, and a Master's
                        thesis written by Sipprell scholar Mary Kennedy McCabe.</p>
