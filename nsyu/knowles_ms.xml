		<p>Malcolm S. Knowles (1913-1997) was an American adult education scholar, consultant, and professor. </p><p>Malcolm S. Knowles was born August 24, 1913 in Livingston, Montana. Following his graduation from Palm Beach, Florida High School in 1930, he enrolled in Harvard College where he obtained his A.B. in 1934. He completed his academic studies at the University of Chicago by earning an M.A. in 1949 and a Ph.D. in 1960. He married Hulda Fornell in 1935 by whom he had two children; Eric (1941) and Barbara E.

Education as an affiliated association of the AEA/USA. From
1960-1974 he was a Professor of Education at Boston University.
With the start of the fall semester, 1974 he taught as Professor
of Adult and Community Education at North Carolina State University in Raleigh until his retirement in 1979.

			<head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
			<p><emph render="bold">Associations</emph> includes all information specific to the identity of an organization with which Knowles had some affiliation. The series is arranged alphabetically by name of association. Designated materials are annual reports, informational pamphlets, constitutions, and directories.

<emph render="bold">Biographical</emph> series has vitae arranged alphabetically. <emph render="bold">Correspondence -

business</emph> comprises letters to and from Knowles, grouped by subject matter (i.e., letters connected with an organization or writing project of Knowles). Arrangement is alphabetical by subject and chronological arrangement rules within a subject.

<emph render="bold">Correspondence -

personal</emph> contains daily correspondence to and from Knowles. The arrangement is chronological.

</p><p><emph render="bold">Meetings files</emph> contains files that Knowles maintained for conferences and other meetings
which he attended. The meetings are identified by their sponsors which appear in alphabetical order. Multiple meetings by a single sponsor are further divided by date
(earliest to latest) or conference title.

<emph render="bold">Photographs</emph> are arranged alphabetically by identifier.

</p><p><emph render="bold">Printed material</emph> (substantive works such as organization publications, articles, journals, papers, and grant proposals) is arranged alphabetically by, in most instances, corporate body or title of work for personal authors. Articles by Knowles will not be found under title, however; these appear under the subseries "Articles by Knowles." Knowles' other papers are interfiled by title among all printed material.

<emph render="bold">Published material</emph> comprises material that has an identifiable copyright. Arrangement is alphabetical by corporate author or title as is the case for personal authors or works without a stated author.

</p><p>Knowles' <emph render="bold">Scrapbooks</emph> chronicle his late adolescence and
early career years. They are ordered
alphabetically by scrapbook name.

<emph render="bold">Workshop files</emph> consists of the documentation that Knowles kept for workshops he conducted. The files are arranged alphabetically by workshop sponsor or title if no sponsor is
identified. In cases of multiple workshops by a single sponsor an alphabetical and/or chronological order takes over.

</p><p>Finally, <emph render="bold">Audio-visual</emph> contains graphics, films and tapes (videocassette, audiocassette and reel-to-reel). Material is grouped by type and within type is ordered alphabetically.</p><p>Due to the arrangement of material by type, a given individual or organization may appear in several of the series -- for example, Boston University appears in Associations, Printed material, Speeches, and Workshop files.  The researcher is advised to review the entire finding aid to ensure no relevant material is overlooked.</p>
