      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>John Smith Sewall (1830-1911) was an American sailor, minister, and professor who is best known for his book <emph render="italic">The Ship's Log of the Captain's Clerk: Adventures in the China Seas</emph>, which tells of his experiences aboard the <emph render="italic">U.S.S. Saratoga</emph>.</p>
      <p>Sewall was born in 1830.  After graduating from Bowdoin College in Portland, Maine in 1850, Sewall enlisted in the United States Navy.  His first assignment was to the



        <emph render="italic">U.S.S. Saratoga</emph> as a captain's clerk.  This ship accompanied Commodore Matthew C. Perry to Japan from 1853-1854.</p>
      <p>Once back in the United States, Sewall was ordained a Congregational minister.  He worked as a pastor in Wenham, Massachusetts from 1859-1867.  Sewall then served as Chaplain to the 8th Massachusetts regiment during the Civil War in 1864.</p>
      <p>In 1875, Sewall accepted a professorship position at Bowdoin College, where he remained until 1903.  Two years later, Sewall wrote a book,



        <emph render="italic">The Ship's Log of the Captain's Clerk: Adventures in the China Seas</emph>, about his experiences aboard the <emph render="italic">U.S.S. Saratoga</emph>.  He died in 1911.</p>
