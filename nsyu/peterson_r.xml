      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Roy Eric Peterson (1936- ) is a Canadian cartoonist.    </p>
      <p>Roy Peterson was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1936 and attended the Kitsilano Secondary school in Vancouver, British Columbia. His two older brothers, both causalities of World War II, encouraged Peterson’s interest in drawing. In 1962, Peterson joined the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Vancouver Sun</emph>, replacing Len Norris. His work also appeared in 
        
        <emph render="italic">Punch</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Time</emph> and from 1978 to 2001 in 
        
        <emph render="italic">MacLean’s</emph> where it was used to illustrate Allan Fotheringham’s column. </p>
      <p>During the 1970s with Stanley Burke, Peterson produced a book series including 
        
        <emph render="italic">Frog Fables and Beaver Tales</emph> (1973) and 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Day of the Glorious Revolution</emph> (1974) that sold over 250,000 copies. Peterson also published 
        
        <emph render="italic">Drawn &amp; quartered: the Trudeau years</emph> in 1984. </p>
      <p>Peterson helped found the Association of Canadian Editorial Cartoonists and in 1990 served as its president. In 1983 he was elected president of the American Association of Editorial Cartoonists, the first Canadian to hold that position. Several National Newspaper awards have been given to Peterson (the most for a Canadian journalist) and in 2004 he became an Officer of the Order of Canada. He also received a Montreal International Salon of Humor Grand Prix. His work has appeared in the series, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year</emph>.</p>
      <p>Roy Peterson’s career with the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Vancouver Sun</emph> ended with his layoff from the paper and his last cartoon appeared on May 31, 2009. His farewell cartoon was not published. </p>
