      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Henry Harris Barroll was born in New Madrid, Missouri in 1850.  
		He was educated both in New Madrid and in Jackson, Missouri, where his family resided 
		in 1858. In 1867, he entered the United States Naval Academy.  Barroll graduated from 
		the Academy as part of the class of 1871 and began a successful military career, being 
		promoted to commander in 1899.  He voluntarily retired in this grade, from active service, 
		under what is known as "the Act of March 3, 1899," but continued on shore-duty at the 
		Hydrographic Office in Washington D.C.</p>
      <p>During the Spanish American War, Barroll served on the blockades of Havana and Santiago 
		and also in guarding the Yucatan Channel. He participated in the capture of Guantanamo and 
		received, through Congress, two medals for conspicuous service during this war, one for 
		services at Santiago, and one for service at Guantanamo.</p>
      <p>On November 5, 1884, Barroll married Elizabeth Johnson Brady.  Brady was born in New 
		Orleans, Louisiana on December 6, 1860 as the second daughter of Matthew Brady and Mary 
		Elizabeth (Johnson) Brady, of West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana. Together Barroll and 
		his wife had one son, Henry Harris Barroll Jr. Elizabeth died in Palm Springs, Florida on 
		February 6, 1886. Her son married Edwina Watson Knapp, daughter of Edwin Fitch Knapp and 
		Helen (Cotter) Knapp of South Norwalk, Connecticut, on June 3, 1908.</p>
      <p>On October 3, 1889, Barroll  remarried to a woman named Marie Louise Hoyt.  Hoyt was born in 
		Danbury, Connecticut, as the second daughter of Thomas Granville Hoyt and Julia Elizabeth 
		(Holt) Hoyt.  Barroll and Hoyt had no children together.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"A bright idea struck me today and as I am attacked that way very seldom I concluded to put it into practice. It is to make this a kind of autobiography as well as a journal for the future. I have had such a varied life that I think it might thus be made interesting to others and so far that is something which has never been accomplished in diaries."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Thus begins the journal kept by U.S. Naval officer Henry Harris Barroll during his early years at sea. These early voyages were often in the West Indies, French Polynesia, and the Virgin Islands. Barroll provides much detail concerning the social scene, natives and their practices, and geography, especially during the longer anchorages at Barbados, Antigua, Martinique, Samoa, and Tahiti. He also relates a return trip to New York City.</p>
      <p>In keeping with the autobiographical journal approach, the captains and crew, sailing conditions and amusements are all mentioned. Barroll's comments on books he has read, some in French, are of particular interest as insight into the reading habits of the mid-1800s. At the end of the volume Barroll has recorded his completed reading for the year 1876. Sixty-six titles are listed with a one or two word comment. Titles of Dumas (Pere &amp; fils) were found to be "good," Jules Verne "instructive," 
        
        <emph render="italic">Christmas Stories</emph> (Dickens) "very good," and Henry James' 
        
        <emph render="italic">Daisy Miller</emph> "poor."</p>
      <p>A few photographs, largely of natives, have been affixed to the pages bearing relevant text. The following pages are blank: 186-188, 190, 192-195, 207-310.</p>
