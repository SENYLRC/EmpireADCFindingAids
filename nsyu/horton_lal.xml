      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Lucy Ann Lewis (1812-1901) was a housewife in 19th century Whitestown, New York.</p>
	  <p>Lucy was born in Whitestown, Oneida County, New York on December 13, 1812. Her parents were William R. and 
	  Charlotte Lewis.  She married David Millard Horton in Sennett on January 10, 1842, the marriage being performed by the 
	  Rev. G.W.Montgomery. David Horton was born on June 13, 1819 at the Horton homestead in Throop. He inherited a thriving and 
	  prosperous farm from his family, and also ran a coal and phosphate business . He was a member of the Democratic party. He was 
	  active in community affairs.</p>
      <p>The Hortons had four children, Charlotte, Josephine, William L. and Hiram F. Charlotte married Leander J. Olmstead of Des 
	  Moines, Iowa, and had two children, Millard A. and Clarence.	Josephine married J. M. Treat, and had two children Edna and 
	  Lulu. Hiram married Lucy M. Skeel.</p>
	  <p>Lucy Ann Lewis Horton kept a diary for two years, in 1877 and 1878, which gives insight into her daily life.  It also  
	  gives a picture of the great physical demands on women of that era and the enormous work-loads they managed each day. On 
	  March 30, 1877 (age 65) she wrote:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Fri. pleasant baked five loaves of bread fried a half bushel of cakes made 6 pies took up the kitchen carpet - Mrs. 
	  Servis came in Lewis went to town sold four doz #12 eggs at 15 per dozen 62 bought 2# raisins for one shilling per pound Mr &amp; 
	  Mrs Hopkins came in the eve.</p></blockquote>
	  <p>Sun. Jan 14, 1877, tells something of the isolation bad weather could cause:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Sun. snows &amp; blows my head aches they say not a team passed but one.</p></blockquote>
	  <p>Mrs. Horton died on October 9, 1901 at the Horton homestead in Throop, Mr. Horton died on April 28, 1907 at the homestead.  
	  Both are buried at Pine Hill Cemetery.</p>
