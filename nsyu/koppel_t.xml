         <p>Edward James Martin "Ted" Koppel (1940 February 8- ) is an English-born American broadcast journalist, television news anchor and author. He is most known for his twenty-five year tenure as anchor and managing editor of the ABC News program <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph>.</p>
         <p>Ted Koppel was born on February 8, 1940 in the town of Nelson in Lancashire, England to German Jewish parents who had fled their home country just prior to the start of World War II. Koppel's father, Erwin Koppel, had owned a tire manufacturing company in Germany, and his mother, Alice Koppel, had been an amateur opera singer. The experience of the war in England and its immediate aftermath had an enduring impact on Koppel, and he has recounted in various contexts the influence the BBC radio rebroadcasts of Edward R. Murrow's war reporting had on his early ambitions to pursue a career in journalism. From 1951-1953, Koppel attended the Abbotsholme School in Staffordshire, England, spending summers and vacations with his parents in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1953, Koppel emigrated with his parents to the U.S.</p>
         <p>At the age of sixteen, Ted Koppel enrolled at Syracuse University to pursue a major in
            Speech and Political Science. During his four years at Syracuse University (1956-1960),
            Koppel was active as an announcer/disc jockey at the University's radio station WAER and
            served as the station's Program Director during his senior year (1959-1960). During his
            final year at Syracuse, Koppel broadcast a self-produced radio report, <emph render="doublequote">This is Moscow</emph>, comprised of interview clips and
            commentary collected on a summer trip to Moscow on the occasion of the American
            Exhibition there. After earning his Bachelor of Science degree from Syracuse University,
            Koppel attended graduate school at Stanford University studying Mass Communications and
            Political Science (1960-1962). He was awarded a Master of Arts degree in 1962 with the
            submission of his graduate thesis, <emph render="doublequote">Attitudinal and
               informational changes precipitated by local newspaper coverage of the Eichmann
               trial</emph>. While at Stanford, Koppel met his future wife Grace Anne Dorney. They
            were married in 1963, the same year that Koppel became a naturalized U.S. citizen.</p>
         <p>After graduation from Stanford, Koppel served a short internship at the NBC network
            before landing his first job as a copyboy for WMCA radio in New York. A year later,
            Koppel was hired on at ABC News radio along with Stewart Klein, Charlie Osgood, Betty
            Adams, Howard Hodkins and former WMCA disc jockey Jim Harriott to staff a new daily news
            program, <emph render="italic">Flair Reports</emph>. Koppel had only been at ABC News a
            few months when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and one of his first on-air
            assignments was to stake out the Vice President's residence to solicit comments from
            Lyndon Johnson. In 1965, Koppel spent several weeks in Selma, Alabama covering the
            fallout from the Edmund Pettus Bridge incident and the civil rights marches that
            followed.</p>
         <p> Koppel made the shift from radio to television in 1966 when ABC News recruited him to
            cover the Vietnam War as a foreign television correspondent (1966-1967). While in
            Vietnam, Koppel produced regular reports for the ABC evening news. In 1968, Koppel
            returned to the U.S. to cover the Nixon presidential campaign and to serve as Miami
            Bureau Chief covering Latin American and Cuban affairs. The following year, Koppel was
            back covering the Vietnam War as Southeast Asia Bureau Chief stationed in Hong Kong
            (1968-1971). In 1971, Koppel began his first stint as ABC's Chief Diplomatic
            Correspondent covering Secretary of State William P. Rogers, and then Secretary of State
            Henry Kissinger through the Watergate years. In this post, Koppel did extensive
            reporting on China, including traveling with President Nixon on his historic visit to
            China in 1972. In 1974, Koppel traveled with Henry Kissinger on his shuttle-diplomacy
            efforts in the Middle East. From 1975-1977, Koppel served as anchor for <emph render="italic">The ABC Saturday Night News</emph>. During a brief hiatus in 1976
            while his wife attended law school, Koppel produced daily ABC radio commentaries while
            collaborating with Marvin Kalb on a novel on Middle East affairs, <emph render="italic">In the National Interest</emph>. In 1978, Koppel produced <emph render="doublequote">Second to None</emph>, a ground-breaking eleven-part report about US-Soviet military
            preparedness. That year also saw Koppel return for his second stint covering the State
            Department (1978-1980). </p>
         <p>As Chief Diplomatic Correspondent covering the Carter State Department in late-1979,
            Koppel was a key figure in ABC's nightly coverage of the ongoing Iran hostage crisis,
               <emph render="italic">America Held Hostage</emph> (first aired November 8, 1979). In
            addition to his regular State Department reports, Koppel frequently served as a
            substitute anchor for the program, periodically relieving Frank Reynolds behind the
            anchor desk. It was largely the impression he made in this role that influenced then
            president of ABC News Roone Arledge to select Koppel as the founding anchor for the new
            late-night news program, <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> (first aired March 24,
            1980). Evolving out of the Iran hostage update program, <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> grew rapidly into a cornerstone of the network's expanding roster
            of television news programs. For nearly three decades from its inception (1980 -2005),
            Ted Koppel anchored the innovative late-night show that featured a unique mix of
            in-depth reporting, extended live interviews (often with multiple participants), and
            live updates on breaking news stories. In the era before the emergence of the 24 hour
            cable news cycle, <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> was often the only conduit for
            breaking-news between the evening and morning news reports. In addition to creating the
            mold for the modern televisions news magazine program, <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> has contributed important innovations to the practice of television
            journalism including the use of simultaneous live satellite interviews with multiple
            participants; the use "natural sound" narration (the "Petacque" technique); the
            town-meeting discussion/debate format; and the use of Hi8 and hand-held video cameras
            for the collection of original news footage.</p>
         <p>In 1987, at the height of <emph render="italic">Nightline's</emph> initial success,
            Koppel entered into contract negotiations with the ABC network and its parent company at
            that time, Capital Cities Communications. Part of these negotiations focused on Koppel's
            desire to establish his own production company, and in March of 1988 ABC News finalized
            an agreement to assist in the formation of Koppel's new venture, Koppel Communications
            Inc. (KCI). ABC agreed to air several KCI-produced news specials and documentaries each
            year (<emph render="italic">The Koppel Report</emph>), as well as allowing Koppel to
            produce additional programs for independent distribution through other outlets. Such a
            deal was virtually unprecedented at its time for a network news figure. <emph render="italic">The Koppel Report</emph>, anchored by Ted Koppel and featuring the
            production talents of a number of his <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> colleagues,
            was an award-winning program that saw the production of 11 news programs over three
            years (1988-1990). Typically in a documentary format, though also including town hall
            debates, the programs explored in-depth many of the major events of the day. Programs
            included examinations of the televangelist phenomenon (<emph render="doublequote">The
               Billion Dollar Pie</emph>), life in the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War
               (<emph render="doublequote">Sex in the Soviet Union</emph>), the events of the
            Romanian Revolution (<emph render="doublequote">Death of a Dictator</emph>), and the
            Tiananmen Square uprising in Beijing (<emph render="doublequote">Tragedy at Tiananmen:
               The Untold Story</emph>).</p>
         <p>In 2005, after twenty-five years and with nearly 6,600 episodes under his belt, Ted
            Koppel decided to move on from his role as anchor and managing editor on <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph>. His last program aired November 22, 2005. Shortly
            after leaving ABC News, Koppel, former <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> Executive
            Producer Tom Bettag, and a group of eight other former <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> staffers formed a deal with the Discovery Channel to produce a
            series of news programs and documentaries for cable television. The subsequent <emph render="italic">Koppel on Discovery</emph> (2006-2008) productions included: <emph render="doublequote">The Price of Security</emph>; <emph render="doublequote">Iran:
               Most Dangerous Nation</emph>; <emph render="doublequote">Our Children's Children's
               War</emph>; <emph render="doublequote">Living with Cancer</emph>; <emph render="doublequote">Breaking Point</emph>; <emph render="doublequote">The Last
               Lynching</emph>; and a much acclaimed four-part series on China, <emph render="doublequote">The People's Republic of Capitalism</emph>. This in-depth
            exploration of the modern Chinese economy has been singled-out by Koppel as one of his
            most satisfying documentary achievements.</p>
         <p>After 2008, Koppel remained active as a broadcaster, author and speaker, serving as a
            news analyst for National Public Radio, a contributor to BBC America, and a
            correspondent for the NBC News program <emph render="italic">Rock Center with Brian
               Williams</emph>. In addition, Koppel has contributed articles to numerous books and
            publications, including <emph render="italic">Forbes</emph>, <emph render="italic">The
               New York Times</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Wall Street Journal</emph>.</p>
         <p>In addition to his voluminous broadcast work, Koppel has accumulated a number of writing
            credits as well. Some of his written works include: <emph render="italic">In the
               National Interest</emph> (1977, with Marvin Kalb); <emph render="italic">Nightline:
               History in the Making and the Making of Television</emph> (1996, with Kyle Gibson);
               <emph render="italic">Live from the Trenches: The Changing Role of the Television
               News Correspondent</emph> (1998, contributor); <emph render="italic">Off Camera:
               Private Thoughts Made Public</emph> (2000); <emph render="italic">Lights Out: A
               Cyberattack, A Nation Unprepared, Surviving the Aftermath</emph> (2015).</p>
         <p>Ted Koppel has received numerous awards and recognitions over the course of his long career including: the Edward R. Murrow Lifetime Achievement Award, 41 Emmy awards, eight George Foster Peabody Awards, 10 duPont-Columbia Awards, 10 Overseas Press Club Awards, two George Polk Awards, and 2 Sigma Delta Chi Awards. Koppel was awarded the first Gold Baton (duPont-Columbia Awards) for Nightline's week-long series originating from South Africa, the Gabriel Personal-Achievement Award from the National Catholic Association of Broadcasters and Communicators, and selection as a Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the Republic of France. He has received more than 20 honorary degrees from universities in the United States.</p>

               <p>After leaving <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> in November of 2005, Koppel,
                     <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> Executive Producer Tom Bettag, and a
                  group of eight other <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> staffers formalized an
                  agreement with Discovery Networks to produce a series of documentaries and other
                  long-form news programs. Over the course of nearly three years, Koppel and company
                  delivered seven documentaries, including a much acclaimed four-part series on
                  China, "The People's Republic of Capitalism". This in-depth exploration of the
                  modern Chinese economy has been singled-out by Koppel as one of his most
                  satisfying documentary achievements. Other <emph render="italic">Koppel on
                     Discovery</emph> programs include: "The Price of Security"; "Iran: Most
                  Dangerous Nation"; "Our Children's Children's War"; "Living with Cancer";
                  "Breaking Point"; and "The Last Lynching".</p>
               <p>The Ted Koppel Collection contains a few dozen VHS tapes related to two separate
                     <emph render="italic">Koppel on Discovery</emph> documentaries: <ref target="Price">The Price of Security</ref> and <ref target="Peoples">The
                     People's Republic of Capitalism</ref>. Most of these tapes are post-production
                  rough-cuts, or "screeners", of the four-part China documentary.</p>

                  <p>This post-9/11 examination of national security policy was Koppel's fist
                     documentary production for Discovery. An original 90 minute documentary was
                     followed by an additional 90 minute town hall segment. Issues such as airport
                     security, detention policy, torture, Guantanamo Bay, NSA mass surveillance are
                     examined in light of the tension between security needs and individual
                     liberties.</p>
                  <p>The collection contains VHS copies of the documentary portion of the broadcast

               <p>This award-winning program, anchored by Ted Koppel and featuring the production
                  talents of a number of<emph render="italic"> Nightline</emph> veterans, included
                  eleven episodes over three-years covering such diverse topics as television,
                  religion, human sexuality, crime and punishment, technology, and international
                  politics. Typically in a documentary format, though at times including town hall
                  debates, <emph render="italic">The Koppel Report</emph> explored in-depth many of
                  the major events of the day, and in the process documented not only the primary
                  historical record of events, but also reflected how those events were perceived

                  original footage of complete interviews, field footage of important places and
                  developing events, clip reels of relevant news footage and historical footage,

                     Production: Koppel Communications Inc. </p>
                  <p>This program explores the phenomenon of Christian television evangelism. The
                     opening segment establishes a contrast between small, grass roots
                     congregations, like the Reverend John Sherfy's congregation, and the large,
                     lucrative ministries of the most popular "televangelists". The decline of
                     religious broadcasting is attributed to the shrinking demographic that has
                     traditionally provided the bulk of the funding (through religious donations)
                     and the proliferation of sexual misconduct scandals, infighting among the
                     ministries and financial corruption. The bulk of the program centers on a
                     town-hall-style panel discussion from the Central Church in Memphis, Tennessee.
                     The discussion focuses on topics such as the corrupting force of big-money on
                     religious broadcasters and Christian ministry in general, the limited growth
                     potential of the audience for religious broadcasting, the impact of
                     high-profile scandals on the biggest television ministries, and the destructive
                     affects of intensive competition among the ministries for a diminishing slice
                     of the revenue pie.</p>
                  <p>Total media holdings related to this program include approximately 150 items
                     (about 100 hours). The majority of this consists of original footage of
                     churches, church services and interviews with preachers and congregants. The
                     collection also includes clip compilations and dubs of various televangelist
                     productions, as well as the complete original recordings of the televangelist
                     studio debate filmed in Memphis. In addition to a batch of post-production
                     material, there are multiple versions of the final show, including two
                     broadcast masters. </p>

                  <p>Executive Producer: Phyllis McGrady; Production: Koppel Communications Inc.,
                     ABC News, Gosteleradio.</p>
                  <p>This dramatic staging of a crisis game (war game) featuring high-ranking former
                     and current US and Soviet officials--the first such joint exercise ever
                     conducted--documents the decision making process involved in managing a
                     full-scale international crisis within a late-Cold War context. Two groups of
                     decision makers--one in Washington, the other in Moscow--are presented with a
                     progressively developing hypothetical situation by the program's producers. The
                     hypothetical crisis begins with the announcement of a series of destabilizing
                     attacks against the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan, and progresses to
                     include a chemical terrorist attack against the President and his cabinet,
                     producing a presidential succession crisis that complicates the US diplomatic
                     and military response.</p>
                  <p>A near majority of the tapes for this program (90-100) are original footage of
                     the war games and the in-studio footage from multiple cameras at both the US
                     and Moscow locations. There are 25 tapes of US and Moscow Director's cuts of
                     the original footage material. Various clips reels and original location
                     footage (Washington DC, Pentagon, White House, Kremlin, etc.), used for set
                     pieces, consists of 30-40 tapes, while there are around 40-45 tapes of
                     post-production material (music, audio, translations, graphics, dub reels and
                     protection copies). The collection also contains the broadcast master tapes for
                     both US and international distribution.</p>

                     a special edition of Nightline, DC: Divided City, a National Town Meeting. ...
                     to discuss the relationship between drugs, crime and racism. [Participants

                  <p>The vast bulk of this material is comprised of original footage ("field betas")
                     including: b-roll, helicopter aerial and location footage from all over the DC
                     area; documentary footage related to various aspects of life in the DC
                     community (crime, violence, church, housing, schools, nightlife, Georgetown

                  <p>This documentary report on the Romanian Revolution of 1989-1990 provides and
                     authoritative recounting of the tumultuous and at time chaotic events that
                     unfolded in Timisoara, Bucharest and across Romania with the fall of the
                     Ceausescu communist regime. Extensive interviews with key figures and original
                     footage of events on the ground combine with an unprecedented post-Revolution
                     view into the world "behind the curtain" in a Soviet-bloc country at the end of
                     the Cold War. This program won an Emmy and a Peabody Award in 1990.</p>
                  <p>The vast majority of the tapes associated with this report are original
                     footage, mostly field tapes, from Bucharest and Timisoara, Romania (Jan-Mar
                     1990). This footage includes many multi-tape interviews with important military
                     and government officials, including Prime Minister Petre Roman; interviews and
                     footage of ordinary Romanian citizens; and footage of demonstrations, the
                     toppling of a Lenin statue and other significant events. In addition, there are
                     many tapes of original news reporting from Romanian and American television
                     sources (RTV and ABC London footage), dubs of international news broadcasts
                     from multiple sources and clip reels of historical/file footage. In addition to
                     the broadcast masters, there is only a very small amount of the typical post-
                     production material present.</p>

                        only Romania's led to massive bloodshed. It was the most violent, the most
                        confusing, and the least conclusive of all the uprisings. All of the hatred,
                        the fear, the rebellion was directed at Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, the
                        Romanian dictator and his wife who had ruled this country with an iron fist
                        for a generation. ... And when the hostility finally erupted, the battles
                        were fought in, and under, the streets of Bucharest, exposing a dark world
                        that still haunts the Romanian psyche."</abstract>

                        Military officers arrive at the listening post. Koppel presses military
                        officers about the listening post and their refusal to let the camera crew
                        enter. Military officers begin to cooperate with Koppel and they are allowed

                  <p>This documentary examines the effects of the War on Drugs and drug enforcement
                     policy on the criminal justice system in New York City. Tracking a few
                     representative cases through the criminal justice process, the program looks at
                     the roles of judges, defense attorneys, prosecutors, police and defendants in a
                     system that is strained to the breaking point. The bulk of the program focuses
                     on the narcotics trial of defendant Desmond Legister. Short segments also focus
                     on the work of in-the-field undercover police officers at the Port Authority
                     bus terminal, the workings of "Part N", a special court established to handle
                     the overload of narcotics cases, and a look at the city's Family Court with the
                     views of presiding judge, Judith Sheindlin. This program won a Golden Gavel
                     Award from the American Bar Association in 1990.</p>
                  <p>The vast majority of the tapes associated with this program are original
                     footage field recordings of court proceedings, police activities, jail
                     procedures and extensive interviews with lawyers, judges, defendants and
                     police. Subjects featured include: Detective Sergeant Richard Canale, Jeremy
                     Schneider, Patrick Joyce, and Marty Murphy of the New York City Legal Aid
                     Society, New York Supreme Court Judge Budd Goodman, Chief Assistant District
                     Attorney Robert Silbering, and New York Family Court Judge Judith Sheindlin
                     (later famous as Television's "Judge Judy"). Approximately 200 of the 408 tapes
                     contain original footage recordings of daily trial proceedings primarily
                     related to 2 cases (multiple cameras over multiple days): the Comacho trial and
                     the Legister trial. The collection contains a batch of police undercover audio
                     tapes, the audibility of which was central to the Legister trial. There is a
                     very small amount of post-production material (mostly graphics and audio
                     tracks) in addition to broadcast masters.</p>

                     solution to our nation's drug problem. It is without question the most
                     controversial. What would happen if we legalized marijuana, cocaine, even
                     heroin? ABC News correspondents, and our affiliates, have been compiling
                     answers to that question for months." This Koppel Report/Nightline town hall
                     meeting features panel discussion with questions from the live audience and via
                     telephone call-in. Short setup pieces cover specific drug use and drug policy
                     issues, including the effectiveness of interdiction/criminalization, cigarettes
                     (nicotine), media/Hollywood representations of drugs and drug use mixed
                     signals).</p>
                  <p>There is a single Betacam tape labeled "Koppel Report: Drug Legalization", and
                     a 1" C dub of the original master. In addition to these tapes, there are 2 VHS
                     tapes covering the 2 hour <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> town meeting
                     (labeled: "1st hour" and "2nd hour").</p>

                     Manager: Ted Koppel; Production: Koppel Communications Inc.</p>
                  <p>Based on the conceit of explaining the world of 1988 to future generations or
                     to life forms on distant planets, this documentary touches on such topics as
                     the natural world, technology, religion, international politics and public
                     health policy. The program features short presentations on a number of topics
                     including Billy Graham on religion, Richard Nixon on US-Soviet relations,
                     Jean-Michel Costeau on the state of the environment, Jane Goodall on endangered
                     species, Jean-Pierre Hocke on the United Nations and the world refugee crisis,
                     Desmond Tutu on racism, Nita Barrow on the state of the developing world, Steve
                     Jobs on computer technology and Stevie Wonder on music.</p>
                  <p>The majority of the tape holdings for this program are short segment pieces
                     with Richard Nixon, Jean-Michel Cousteau, Desmond Tutu, C. Everett Koop, Nita
                     Barrows, Billy Graham, Carl Sagan, Jane Goodall, Steve Jobs, Stevie Wonder and
                     others. Tapes include original footage versions, masters and protection copies.
                     Approximately 35-40 tapes are post-production materials, and there are several
                     quality dubs of the final program, as well as three broadcast masters.</p>

                  <p>This documentary examines the dramatic transformations in the Soviet Union
                     through the lens of human sexuality. The program considers a host of
                     issues—abortion, family planning, homosexuality, dating, AIDS, pornography and
                     prostitution—providing an in-depth view of Soviet society in the midst of the
                     Glasnost era. Interviews include doctors, government officials, sex workers,
                     artists and ordinary citizens.</p>
                  <p>Much of the material associated with this program is original footage (Jul-Nov
                     1990) containing: multi-tape interviews with doctors, government officials,
                     ordinary citizens, artists and sex workers; location and b-roll footage related
                     to the many elements explored by the program; hidden camera ("hat cam")
                     footage, etc. Most of the remaining tapes (about 50) are clip reels and dubs
                     from Soviet television and film documentaries. There are about 30
                     post-production tapes, especially audio voiceovers and translations. There are
                     two broadcast masters, as well as D-2 digital tape copies of the final
                     broadcast version of the show.</p>

                  <p>This documentary explores in-depth the international democratization of
                     television media and message control brought on by the wide spread availability
                     of camcorders, VCRs and other media technologies. Topics analyzed include
                     Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega's video conferencing outreach efforts; the
                     importance of television and video to the revolutions in Eastern Europe,
                     particularly the Solidarity movement in Poland; the influence on world opinion
                     of first-hand documentation of the Palestinian experience during the First
                     Intifada; the evolution of Soviet television and public relations during the
                     Gorbachev/Glasnost era; the extent and limits of government television
                     propoganda efforts like those carried out by the US Information Agency and it's
                     international Worldnet television service.</p>
                  <p>There are around 90 tapes of dubs and clips from international television
                     broadcasts, including World Net programming; US TV shows like Dallas, Cosby and
                     The Price is Right; examples of Soviet television programming; broadcast news
                     footage of events in Poland (Solidarity movement) and the Middle East
                     (Palestine). The majority of the holdings (160 tapes) consists of: original
                     footage interviews, b-roll and field footage including interviews with Lawrence
                     Eagleburger, Richard Holbrook, General Secord, Ted Turner, Roger Ailes and many
                     others; footage and interviews related to USIA/World Net operations; many hours
                     of footage of interviews on Soviet television, including a many part interview
                     with Vladimir Posner; original footage and interviews related to Poland and the
                     Middle East. A substantial number of tapes (approximately 45) are
                     post-production materials, mostly bump-ups and clip reels compiled from the
                     clip tapes, but also including audio masters, graphics and edit masters of the
                     final segments. There are 2 broadcast masters of the final program.</p>

                        States by opposing forces, the use of television as an instrument of policy,
                        and how the impact of television can differ depending on the situation.
                        Eagleburger uses the example of the Iran Hostage Crisis in comparison to how

                        policy. Eagleburger also discusses his opinion of CNN and Ted

                  <p>Ted Koppel anchors with guests Nelson Mandela, Rev. Calvin Butts, Gloria Toote,
                     Koos van der Merwe (via taped statement), and others. Two-part broadcast began
                     with one hour at 10:00 PM EST (<emph render="italic">The Koppel Report</emph>)
                     and a follow-up <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> hour in the usual time
                     slot.</p>
                  <p>From the program introduction: "And now, Thursday, June 21st, Nelson Mandela
                     comes to Harlem. Seven years ago, while he was still in prison in South Africa,
                     Mandela was awarded an honorary doctorate in absentia at this University.
                     Today, he comes to City College of New York in person, to participate in a town
                     meeting." This joint Koppel Report/Nightline town meeting with Nelson Mandela
                     includes questions from moderator Ted Koppel and from the live audience
                     touching on such topics as: racism; apartheid; US South African policy and
                     sanctions; South African politics and economic development; the South African
                     democracy movement; the ANC's association with the PLO, Libya and Cuba;
                     relations between the ANC and other black South African parties.</p>
                  <p>There is a single 1 inch videotape master for the first hour of the program and
                     a single VHS dub of the follow-up Nightline hour.</p>

                  <p>From the program introduction: "Several weeks ago, before the killing and while
                     the student protest movement was at its peak, we dispatched a number of
                     Chinese-speaking specialists, journalists, and academics to come here [Beijing]
                     and piece together the background of the story. Much of what they, and we, have
                     learned has never been reported before. The 'Goddess of Democracy' [statue] for
                     example: if all had gone according to plan, the students would have left
                     Tiananmen days before the shooting began; she would have been their surrogate,
                     their symbol in an empty square. We will tell of a clandestine meeting, in of
                     all places a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant at the edge of Tiananmen, where
                     a demoralized student leader sought help in planning an escape before the
                     massacre. And we'll report on the state secret revealed publicly by the
                     Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party [Zhao Ziyang] in the presence
                     of the Secretary General of the Soviet Communist Party [Mikhail Gorbachev];
                     we'll tell you why and how it may have sealed his fate and that of the students
                     in Tiananmen. This is a story about young dreams and old rivalries, of a battle
                     for power that is still underway, of a single chapter in this nation's long
                     history." This program won an Edward R. Murrow Award from the Overseas Press
                     Club and a Silver Baton from the Alfred I. DuPont-Columbia University
                     Awards.</p>

               <p>Executive producer: Tom Bettag; Production: ABC News.</p>
               <p>This short-lived interview program ran for about six months in the time slot after
                     <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph>, during a transitional period in the
                  network's programming schedule. Most episodes of the program centered on profiles
                  and in-depth interviews in informal settings. Interviews normally conducted by Ted
                  Koppel or Chris Bury included a host of interesting names, including humorists
                  David Letterman, Nia Vardalos, Garry Trudeau, Paul Mooney; humanitarian figures
                  Desmond Tutu and Elie Wiesel; and musicians Bruce Springsteen, Ani DiFranco and
                  Steve Earle.</p>
               <p>The collection contains 138 VHS tapes of episodes of this program. Some episodes were re-aired. Each tape runs
                  approximately 30 minutes and includes commercials.</p>

                  Typically, the show was formatted as a panel discussion/debate, often with open

                        250th anniversary of the University of Pennsylvania features panel analysis
                        of the post-Cold War world. Day 1, titled "After the Cold War", features
                        discussion of the transformations in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and
                        the global repercussions of the end of the Cold War. Day 2, titled "The New
                        Global Marketplace", features discussion of the economic transformations in
                        Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and the emergence of global capitalism.
                        Day 3, titled "Culture in the Communications Age", features discussion on
                        the transformations in culture, technology and communications.</p>
                     <p>A sizable chunk of the material collected here—about 30-40 tapes—relates to
                        the University of Pennsylvania montage/feature included in the show (campus
                        highlights and interviews related to U of Penn); these are primarily field
                        tapes and post production materials. In addition to 20-25 tapes of collected
                        clips/bump reels used for the produced segment pieces, the collected
                        production material also includes camera original field tapes of interviews
                        with Kissinger, Walter Mead, Lee Kwan Yew and others featured on the
                        programs (about 20-30 tapes). Camera original footage and masters (multiple
                        cameras, multiple locations) from the broadcasts/debates includes 20-30
                        tapes. Edited versions of segments, masters, protection copies and other
                        post-production elements (graphics and audio) comprise 40-45 tapes. There
                        are D2 digital tape masters available for all three segments.</p>

                     <p>Report on defense economics considers the position of the incoming
                        presidential administration in light of the inherited and unsustainable

                        Options for reducing defense spending are outlined. Report features
                        interviews with experts in the field of defense economics as well as footage

                     <p>This magazine program was a collaboration between Oregon Public Broadcasting
                        and the ABC News <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> unit. Anchored by Michel
                        Martin, each episode presented 3-5 segments centered on a single theme.
                        Episodes were created by independent producers and PBS stations, with
                        editing and post-production work accomplished through the <emph render="italic">Nightline</emph> unit.</p>
                     <p>Holdings for this program include tape dubs in various formats of the
                        following episodes/segments (multiple copies of most): "A Place in Time",
                        "Flying", "Food", "Junk", "Leaving Home", "Milestones", "Money", "Roots",
                        "Six Degrees of Separation", "Voice", and a rough cut "Highlights Reel".</p>
