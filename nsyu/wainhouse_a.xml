      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Austryn Wainhouse (1927-2014) was an American author, publisher and translator, particularly of French works.  He is best known for his translation into English of the complete works of the Marquis de Sade.  </p>
      <p>Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1927, Wainhouse graduated from Harvard University and then traveled in Europe, eventually settling in Paris with his wife Mary ("Muffie") in 1949.  There he worked for Maurice Girodias at Olympia Press, for whom he produced the first unexpurgated English translation of de Sade's 
        
        <emph render="italic">Justine</emph> (1953), and was an editor of Alexander Trocchi's literary magazine 
        
        <emph render="italic">Merlin</emph>.    His letters from this period suggest that his bohemian lifestyle and political leanings somewhat puzzled his father, a long-time American Foreign Service employee and the author of numerous books on peace and arms control.</p>
      <p>By 1960 Wainhouse was divorced and dividing his time between the United States and Europe.   In the mid-1960s he began working with avant-garde publishing house Grove Press to produce an English translation of Sade's complete works, including his 
        
        <emph render="italic">Letters from Vincennes and from the Bastille</emph>.   Wainhouse was given the post of Writer-in-Residence at the Jonas Salk Institute in 1971, where his colleagues included physician Jonas Salk and physicist Jacques Monod; in 1972 he won the National Book Award (Translation) for his translation of Monod's 
        
        <emph render="italic">Chance and Necessity</emph>.</p>
      <p>For the next several years he continued writing and translating from his home in Vermont.  Then in 1982 he established The Marlboro Press  in Marlboro, Vermont, with the goal of publishing English translations of French and Italian works.  "[A]s a publisher [I] could pursue no more responsible course and render no service of greater usefulness to  the American reading public than to strengthen and multiply its imaginative connections with the rest of the world," he wrote in a brief history of the press.   Over the next twenty years the press published more than ninety titles (first under its own imprint and later under the joint imprint of The Marlboro Press/Northwestern University Press), including literary travel, poetry and fiction.</p>
      <p>Wainhouse remained good friends with his former wife Mary ("Muffie") and in the late 1990s he and his wife, Deborah Clayton Wainhouse, relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico where Muffie was living.   Muffie died in 2001.  Wainhouse's affection for France had never waned, and  that same year he and Deborah retired to Uzès in the south of France where he died in 2014.</p>
      <p>Wainhouse had three daughters, Cassandra, Melissa, and Suzannah, and one son, Henry.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Austryn Wainhouse Papers</emph> consists of calendars, correspondence, diaries, 
			financial material, manuscripts, memorabilia, notebooks, Sade material, and a small amount of miscellanea.  
			The collection contains both personal and professional material and spans Wainhouse's entire career, with 
			particular emphasis on his early work including his translations of the Marquis de Sade.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Calendars</emph> consists of 31 small desk calendars, spanning thirty years, with Wainhouse's notes.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> contains both incoming and outgoing letters (Wainhouse often made carbon copies of his 
			letters, even to friends and family).  Notable correspondents include Simone de Beauvoir, Alain Accardo, 
			Georges Bataille, Samuel Beckett, Albert Guerard.  The most extensive correspondence is with Dick Seaver, 
			his editor for the Sade books at Grove Press; with British poet Christopher Logue, a close friend 
			with whom he corresponded for more than forty years; and with his wife Mary (Muffie).</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Diaries</emph> consist of a variety of bound volumes, mostly untitled, spanning about forty years.  The first volume 
			includes Wainhouse's pithy observations on his Navy experience and clippings of some of his columns.  Later 
			volumes cover a summer in Mallorca (Majorca), a year in Geneva, and "Years with Michelle."</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Financial material</emph> includes ledgers in which Wainhouse entered his translations and fees, royalty statements 
			from several publishers, and some miscellaneous notes.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Manuscripts</emph>, one of the largest series, includes original work as well as translations.  Original work includes essays (topics include Baudelaire 
			and "Negroness"), short stories (e.g., "The Prince of Janitzio") and novels (Aftosa, Artra, Hedyphagetica, There Comes a Youth), many 
			of which were apparently never published.  Also here is Wainhouse's master's thesis on E.M. Forster.  Translations include works by Georges Bataille, Maurice Blanchot, 
			Pierre Jean Jouve, Aleksandra Kroh.  Formats include handwritten manuscripts, typescripts, typescript carbons, and others, many with annotations and corrections.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> contains a large number of photographs, two boxes of slides, a few negatives, a scrapbook, and 
			some assorted paper memorabilia (membership cards, etc.)  Nearly all of the photos are candid shots of Wainhouse, 
			family, friends, houses, scenes in Europe, etc.  They have been sleeved for protection, but since most are undated/unlabeled and they arrived in a single box without any organization, no attempt has been made to 
			arrange or categorize them and they remain in random order.</p>
      <p>The collection contains more than twenty spiral 
        
        <emph render="bold">Notebooks</emph>, though not all are found in this series.  
			In some cases, such as the Juliette notebooks (see Sade material below) they were clearly either translations or 
			drafts of original work; these have been filed under Manuscripts or Sade material, depending on their content.  
			What remains in this series are notebooks whose contents either could not be identified, such as one containing 
			practice exercises in Greek and another labeled "Traveler from Peking."</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Sade material</emph> represents nearly a quarter of the collection.  The bulk of this series consists of manuscripts 
			and typescripts of Wainhouse's translations.  There are 13 spiral notebooks filled with Wainhouse's original 
			handwritten translation of Justine, numerous drafts of Letters from Vincennes, drafts of Klossowski's Sade mon 
			prochain, and a handwritten translation of Philosophia dans la boudoir (Philosophy in the Bedroom).
			Also included here are original works by Wainhouse, such as his essay "On translating Sade," the foreword to 
			Juliette Book III, and a "Translator's preface."  There are two folders of publicity, both from Grove and 
			from the press (reviews, articles, etc.), and a few miscellaneous items such as the typescript of 
			"The Boudoir Philosophers," a stage version of Philosophy in the Bedroom written by Eric Kahane.</p>
      <p>The few items of 
        
        <emph render="bold">Miscellany</emph> at the end of the collection consists of photopies of two published novels and a
			random assortment of clippings and printed material.</p>

            <p>The vast majority of these are candid shots of Wainhouse, friends, family, etc.  Very few are labeled.  Lacking dates and descriptions, no attempt has been made to organize these other than to group the obviously older photos together at the beginning.  Subjects include Wainhouse himself at home and at events such as a book signing; friends and family; European travels; Vermont; etc.  There is also a group of photographs of long wooden tables, possibly made by AW.  </p>
