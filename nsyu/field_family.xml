      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>David Dudley Field (1805-1894) was an American lawyer, reformer, author, and U.S. Congressman.</p>
<p>Field was born in Haddam, Connecticut on February 13, 1805. He attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts before studying law in Albany and New York City, New York. In 1829, Field married Jane Lucinda Hopkins with whom he had three children, Dudley, Jeanie and Isabella. After Hopkins death in 1836, Field remarried twice, first to Harriet Davidson (d. 1864) and second to Mary E. Carr (d. 1874). The eldest child, Dudley Field, followed in his father's footsteps, studying law.  He was made a partner in his father's practice in 1854.</p>
<p>David Dudley Field was the author of numerous political and legal works, including works on criminal and civil procedure. He was elected to the 44th Congress to fill the vacancy left by Smith Ely, Jr. and served from January 11 to March 3, 1877.  He died on April 13, 1894 in New York City.</p>
