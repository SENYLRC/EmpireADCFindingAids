      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Rev. Dr. Alonzo Flack (1823-1885) was an American educator and clergyman of the Methodist
        Episcopal Church. He was principal and president at Claverack College and Hudson River
        Insitute from 1855-1885.</p>
      <p>Alonzo Flack was born in Argyle, New York on September 19, 1823. While attending Union
        College (1845-1849), Flack joined the Methodist Episcopal Church and received a license as a
        preacher. He subsequently studied theology at the Concord Biblical Institute in New
        Hampshire and was recrutied by Bishop Osman C. Baker in 1854 to serve as principal for a new
        school at Charlotte. In 1855, Flack became principal of the Claverack College and Hudson
        River Institute. He later assumed the presidency of Claverack College in 1869. Flack was
        noted for his deep belief in the reform movements of the period, including temperance
        reform, the enfranchisment of women and ecclesiastical reform. He was granted a Doctor in
        Philosophy degree by the University of the State of New York in 1875. Much esteemed by his
        students, Flack served for thirty years as a teacher and administrator at the school, until
        his death in 1885. He was succeeded by his son, Rev. Arthur H. Flack, who occupied the
        position until 1900. The College, located in Claverack, New York, offered academic and
        classical studies to ladies and gentlemen and was very highly regarded. Alumni included
        author Stephen Crane, feminist Margaret Sanger, and President Martin van Buren.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Alonzo Flack Papers</emph> includes miscellaneous papers,
        correspondence, manuscripts, lecture and sermon notes.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the collection contains handwritten notes and manuscripts for lectures and
        sermons, as well as a manuscript and notes for a work in development titled <emph render="italic">Sensibilities</emph>. The conceived work, according the author's
        introduction, "is the taking up the whole subject [of sensibility] in a brief and practical
        manner, and so arranging the facts [...] as to give a clear system of Psychology to the
        inquiring student. [...] To assist the student the author has attempted to give clearer
        definitions of the faculties, powers, and states of the mind, than has been given [...]."
        The work was written "for the benefit of the author's own classes" and was derived from
        "oral and written lectures to students, given during an experience of twenty six years in
        teaching." It is unclear from the context in which the material was received (unsorted, in a
        single folder) how the various sermon and lecture manuscripts in the collection relate to
        the <emph render="italic">Sensibilitites</emph> manuscript.</p>
