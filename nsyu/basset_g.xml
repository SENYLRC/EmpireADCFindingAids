      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Gene Basset (1927- ) is an American cartoonist primarily known for his editorial cartoons.</p>
      <p>Born in Brooklyn, New York on July 24, 1927, Gene Basset served with the United States Coast Guard from 1944 to 1946. He then attended the University of Missouri from 1946 to 1947 and also studied at Cooper Union from 1947 to 1950. Basset also studied at Brooklyn College, the Art Students League and the Pratt Institute. He received degrees in both art and psychology. </p>
      <p>During his career, Basset worked in several artistic capacities. From 1951 to 1953, Basset was a sketch artist at the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Indianapolis Times</emph>.  He then drew sports and theatrical cartoons for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> before working as a sports cartoonist at the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Boston Post</emph>.  In 1962, after a brief stint as the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Honolulu Star Bulletin's</emph> first editorial cartoonist, Basset became the chief editorial cartoonist with Scripps Howard newspapers. Beginning in 1972, his work was also syndicated by the United Feature Syndicate. In 1982, Basset joined the staff of the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Atlanta Journal Constitution</emph>. </p>
      <p>Basset was a member of the National Cartoonists Society and the American Association of Editorial Cartoonists of which he was president in 1973. Basset also taught art at the Famous Artists School in Westport, Connecticut from 1957 to 1962. The Population Institute named one of his cartoons the Best Editorial Cartoon in 1974 and his cartoons were reprinted in magazines such as 
        
        <emph render="italic">Time</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Newsweek</emph>. His work has been exhibited at the Pratt Institute and in 2005 drawings done by Basset during a trip to Vietnam were exhibited at Gustavus Adolphus College. </p>
      <p>Basset retired from the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Atlanta Journal Constitution</emph> at the end of 1992. Gene Basset's son, Brian Basset worked as an editorial cartoonist for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Seattle Times</emph> during the 1980s and 1990s and is now a comic strip artist working on 
        
        <emph render="italic">Adam at Home</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Red and Rover</emph>. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The  
        
        <emph render="bold">Gene Basset Papers</emph> consist primarily  of original artwork for editorial cartoons as well as proofs.</p>
      <p>
                                            <emph render="bold">Cartoons</emph> (1962-1969) contains
                                            over 1,300 original cartoons. Most of these cartoons are
                                            dated. They were drawn by Basset while he was with
                                            Scripps Howard. </p>
      <p>Basset's cartoons depict national and international events during this time period. Receiving frequent treatment were the political pursuits of Barry Goldwater and changes within the Republican Party, as well as the escalation and increasing cost of the Vietnam War. </p>
      <p>Worth noting are Basset's cartoons about inflation, Congressional pay raises and the regulation of smoking and tobacco advertising.   Also, following the 1968 presidential election there are several cartoons about the electoral system and electoral college. Also of interest are cartoons depicting Senator Ted Kennedy and the Chappaquiddick scandal and President Richard Nixon's  attempt to appoint Clement Haynsworth to the  Supreme Court. </p>
      <p>Basset worked with pen and ink and also crayon on illustration board and paper. Traces of pencil are visible and some contain zipatone dot screening. Captions appear in ink. Original art varies in size, however most cartoons are 11 1/2" x 14". </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Proofs </emph>includes six undated black and white proofs of cartoons otherwise not appearing in the collection. </p>
