         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>George Pappastavrou, a first-generation American of Greek descent, was a professor of music at Syracuse University and a concert pianist.  He grew up in Syracuse, New York and attended Juilliard as both an undergraduate and graduate student (1949-1956), where he studied under Alton Jones and Irwin Freundlich; his fellow students included the well-known pianist Van Cliburn and soprano Leontyne Price.    In addition to playing and recording in the United States -- particularly the music of composer Charles Ives -- he also toured Russia at the invitation of the Ministry of Culture and sponsored by the USIA (1974), China (1987, 1988), and Singapore (1990).  He was a professor in the Syracuse University School of Music for more than thirty years (1961-1992) and director of the School from 1983-1992.  During his career he knew and worked with a number of notable composers, musicians, dancers and other artists, including Henry Cowell, Calvin Hampton, Howard Boatwright, Aaron Copland, Luise Talma, Louis Krasner, and Martha Graham.</p></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">George Pappastavrou Interviews</emph> consists of six video interviews, recorded over the course of eight days in 2012.  The interviewer is Artis Wodehouse, a musician, musicologist, and former student of Pappastavrou.  The interviews span Pappastavrou's entire career, from his childhood in Syracuse, New York to his days at Juilliard, his travels to Europe, Russia and China, and his years on the faculty at Syracuse University's School of Music.   During the interviews Pappastavrou discusses his teaching philosophy, friends and colleagues (including dancer and choreographer Martha Graham), and his long-standing interest in and work on the music of American modernist composer Charles Ives. In addition to the video interviews, there is one DVD with simultaneously-recorded audio only.</p><p>Each DVD-R has been assigned an ID number; other than that ID number, all information given below, including dates and titles of interviews and the summary of contents, was provided by Ms. Wodehouse.</p>
