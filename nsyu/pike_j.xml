      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>James Pike (1777-1842), the son of John and Martha Trevett Pike, was born in Somersworth, New Hampshire, 
in March 1777.  Without doubt he received at least a common school education since he began teaching 
himself in December 1798.  His first school was at Wakefield, Massachusetts, and it was followed by terms 
at Newbury "Newtown," Salisbury, and Charlestown, Massachusetts, in his home town of Somersworth, New 
Hampshire, and in the Maine towns in Buxton, Berwick, and Portland.  While teaching in Portland he 
wrote and used in his classroom his spelling book <emph render="italic">The Columbian Orthographer</emph>, 
which Daniel Johnson published in 1806.  The work was sufficiently meritorious that several editions 
followed.</p>

<p>Pike was in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1808-1809, preparing copy and reading proof on a dictionary 
to be issued by the Charlestown firm of Etheridge &amp; Bliss.  If the work was published under Pike's 
name, no copy seems to have survived.  He is known to have published one further school text, 
<emph render="italic">The Little Reader</emph>, for which the certificate of copyright, 1814, is in the 
collection.  By October of 1812, Pike's eyesight had failed him after many years of eye trouble.  Apparently 
he was not married when his blindness struck, and it is inferred from material in the collection that he 
was cared for by his family, and that he remained single until his death in 1842 at Somersworth.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">James Pike Papers</emph> consist of commonplaces, correspondence, diaries, legal papers, 
miscellaneous writings, and school materials.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">Commonplaces</emph> consists of eleven items, ten in notebook form, in which 
Pike or members of his family recorded information from books, newspapers, or other sources to which they 
wished to refer subsequently.  Among them is an index to a "History of the World" compiled by Pike.   <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> consists of six letters: two outgoing, three incoming, and 
one to an unidentified publication.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">Diaries</emph> in the collection cover the period 1793-1811, with some gaps, and 
for the most part consist of one- or two-line entries largely concerned with the weather.  A number of 
entries, however, are more full, and describe arrivals, departures, and other events, as well as 
documenting the frequent eye trouble from which Pike suffered.  Some vital records of the Pike family 
and their Somersworth neighbors are also to be found in the diaries.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">Legal papers</emph> include a series of depositions, a certificate of copyright, 
a deed, and two receipts.  Five items on various topics which may 
have been written by Pike constitute <emph render="bold">Miscellaneous writings</emph>.  Of interest 
among these is a draft of a constitution for a "School for Young Ladies."  The last series, 
<emph render="bold">School materials</emph>,  includes two aids compiled or copied by Pike for use in 
the instruction of Latin, and a record of the names of his pupils, 1798-1807.</p>
