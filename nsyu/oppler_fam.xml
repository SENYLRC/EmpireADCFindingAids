         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>The Opplers were an ethnically Jewish and German family from the disputed region of Lorraine. 
	  After the first World War, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to French control and the Opplers were forced 
	  to leave, moving to Berlin.   There, family member Alfred C. Oppler (1893-1982) became a jurist and 
	  civil servant. Although he had been raised as a Protestant, after the  Nazi party took power Oppler 
	  was demoted due to his Jewish heritage and expelled from the civil service. In 1939, he and his wife, 
	  Charlotte Preuss Oppler, immigrated to the United States. Their daughter, Ellen C. Oppler, earned 
	  her BA degree in art history from Smith College and PhD from Columbia	University; she was a professor 
	  of art history at Syracuse University and a noted Picasso scholar. </p></bioghist>
