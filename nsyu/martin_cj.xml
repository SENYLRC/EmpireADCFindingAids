      <p>Cecilie "Jackie" Martin (1903-1969), woman photographer, writer, art director and editor, is an important figure in the early years of American journalism. During the twenties, while working for various Washington D.C. newspapers, Martin discovered her talent for photography which led to a decade-long (1930-40) career as art director, photographer and editor of the Washington

        <emph render="italic">Times-Herald</emph> paved the way for a successful freelance career (1940-50)- she contributed to every major American magazine, published four books, and willingly accepted difficult assignments such as war correspondent in France and Italy, photographer for the Brazilian Air Force, and official photographer for America's first women's army, the WAAC.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>Jackie Martin's recognition has been revived through this collection which includes professional records of Martin's career and personal files for her many assignments, and thousands of photographs and negatives. The










        <emph render="bold">Jackie Martin Papers</emph> is rich with American social and political history from the Great Depression to Post-World War II and contains



        <emph render="bold">Biographical material</emph>,



        <emph render="bold">Correspondece</emph>,



        <emph render="bold">Financial records</emph>,



        <emph render="bold">Projects and assignments</emph>,



        <emph render="bold">Subject files</emph>,



        <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph>,



        <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph>, and



        <emph render="bold">Negatives and contacts</emph>. The collection also provides an insider's view of Washington society during its heyday, a period when extravagant parties were frequent and extravagant people were plenty. Unfortunately, records of Martin's private life are absent leaving one's conclusions about her character to be based on her professional career and business relationships</p>
      <p>The










        <emph render="bold">Biographical material</emph> section contains resumes, fact sheets, and employment applications that provide a clear chronology of Jackie Martin's career in her own words. Numerous accomplishments are reflected in five decades (1920-1970) of newspaper clippings and magazine articles. Background material and reference files for "Jackie Martin: the Washington Years," a 1986 exhibition held at Syracuse University's Lowe Art Gallery, are also in this section. A number of diary entries (1956-1965) and undated notes have been labeled the "surveillance case." So far, their significance is unclear other than the fact that Jackie Martin believed she was being followed, her privacy constantly invaded. These notes remain to be sorted and factual content has yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> are divided into two categories: family and general. Jackie Martin had close ties with her parents, Emma and Philip Martin; an older sister, Lydia (Pugh); a younger sister, Lillian (Clements), and younger brother, Philip Jr. The years of correspondence are consistent with the periods when Jackie was away on assignment. She lived with her parents and worked out of a basement studio in their home until 1948.</p>
      <p>The general category reflects the broad network of business contacts and personal friendships Jackie Martin established and remained loyal to throughout her life. Many contacts were people she photographed in Washington D.C. such as presidents, government officials, prominent politicians, wealthy society hostesses, and magazine/newspaper publishers, writers, and artists. This list includes the President Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, President Truman's family, J. Edgar Hoover, Clare Boothe Luce, Perle Mesta, William Randolph Hearst Jr., Eleanor "Cissy" Patterson, Marjorie Post, Evalyn, McLean, Walter Winchell, Margaret Mitchell, Margaret Bourke-White, Ollie Atkins, Roscoe Drummond, Edward Steichen, and Beaumont Newhall. Others include Army Generals, Ambassadors, Hollywood movie stars (1930s). There are also significant correspondence between Alice Rogers Hager and Jackie Martin who collaborated on several projects together. Correspondence relating to a particular project or assignment can be found throughout the collection, such as World War II, Presidents and leaders, or USIA.</p>
      <p>The










        <emph render="bold">Financial records</emph> (1924-1968) and office files (1957-1968) include income tax figures, receipts, insurance policies, legal documents, and government service records. The office files include the years with Norwood Studios (1957-62) and a variety of projects that were being worked on during the sixties.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Projects and assignments</emph> is a broad heading inclusive of all major career accomplishments, the first being published books:










        <emph render="italic">Bars On Her Shoulders</emph> (1943),










        <emph render="italic">Brazil: Giant To the South</emph> (1945),










        <emph render="italic">Frontier By Air</emph> (1942), and










        <emph render="italic">Washington: City of Destiny</emph> (1949). Clippings, correspondence, manuscripts, journals, and close to 1500 black and white photographs, most complete with captions are included.</p>
      <p>Features are broken down into three catagories: general, magazines, and newspapers. General features are those photographed and research by Jackie Martin lacking references to prove publication. In 1940, her freelance photography career took off and features were published in more than thirty major American magazines including










        <emph render="italic">LIFE</emph>,










        <emph render="italic">Collier's</emph>,

        <emph render="italic">Ladies Home Journal</emph>,










        <emph render="italic">Saturday Evening Post</emph>, and










        <emph render="italic">News-Week</emph>. The Magazine features section contains tearsheets and research files for several of these photo/articles arranged alphabetically by magazine name. Subjects cover a broad scope of the American scene: Washington political and social life, World War II army nurses, the WAACs, smalltown America, sports figures, and professional-career women.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Newspaper features (1930-60) include tearsheets and research files for several photo/articles published in the Washington










        <emph render="italic">Times-Herald</emph>,

        <emph render="italic">New York Daily Journal</emph>, and syndicated nationally through King Features. They are arranged chronologically (with original job title) to retain the sequence created in 1946 when photos were published daily through International News Photos (INP). Major stories include Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, Clare Boothe Luce, the FBI, Gromyko, Bernard Barach, and Blair House.</p>
      <p>The War correspondent section contains one unpublished manuscript and notes for a second relating to World War II army nurses. Correspondence, personal journals, and notes document her war experience. Records on the medical units and U.S. 7th army in Italy and France were the basis for the manuscripts and several magazine features published in 1944-45.</p>
      <p>Photographer for the American Battle Monuments Commission was Jackie Martin's final government assignment (1967). This section documents her trip to American cemeteries in Europe through notes, correspondence, and about 350 photographs.</p>
      <p>Jackie Martin became involved in the United States Foreign Service (1950-57) as chief of the 18-country photo operation for the Marshall Plan stationed in Paris. She was later responsible for organizing the USIA world-wide display of Edward Steichen's "Family of Man" exhibit. This section contains background material, photographs, transcripts, and exhibition catalogs.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Subject files</emph> are divided into Presidents and Leaders, and general. All presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Nixon are represented here through clippings, correspondence, and few photographs. In addition, there are three volumes of a personal scrapbook dedicated to Winston Churchill, photographed (1941-42) and greatly admired by Jackie Martin throughout her life.</p>
      <p>The general subject file category is an extensive reference system created for office use on such topics as United States government, foreign policy, diplomatic lists, communications, and Washington D.C.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> is all information pertaining to clubs and organizations to which Jackie Martin belonged, general clippings, and hundreds of European travel maps and World War II American army maps. There are also sound recordings including several speeches by John F. Kennedy and an interview with Jackie Martin and Alice Rogers Hager on their war experiences.</p>
      <p>The Scrapbooks, carefully organized by Jackie Martin, provide excellent documentation of her photographic career and should be consulted for additional information on almost every subject listed under

This section contains hundreds of others listed alphabetically by subject; most of the them are working photographs with compromised quality. The oversize photographs, especially those prepared for the 1986 exhibition, are of superior quality and exemplify Martin's true talents. (See also
