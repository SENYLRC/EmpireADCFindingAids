      <p>Benjamin Fish Pease (1836-1911) was a cooper, soldier and farmer, first in Michigan and later in Armada Township, Buffalo County, Nebraska.  </p><p>Born in Ontario County, New York to Granger and Anna (Fish) Pease, he moved with his parents to Michigan in 1839.  Pease began to learn the cooper trade when he was eighteen, and followed it for five years. His first wife, whom he was married October 24, 1859, was Martha Judd (1838-1868) by whom he had a son, Herbert.  His second wife, married May 30, 1872, was Charlotte Odell, by whom he had three children: Charles, Salina, and Floyd. </p><p>Pease's interest in 
	  abolition began when he heard a lecture by Henry Bibb, who had escaped slavery in the South, and he was later influenced by 
	  Harriet Beecher Stowe's <emph render="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</emph>.  He worked for abolitionist political parties prior to the Civil War, and after 
	  the fall of Fort Sumter he enlisted with the 8th Michigan Infantry on August 12, 1861.  Captured in June of 1862, he was 
	  exchanged in January of 1863 and returned to his regiment after a short furlough home.  During his enlistment he participated in the Battles of Coosaw and James Island, South Carolina; Pulaski and Wilmington, Georgia; Blue Springs, Kentucky; Jackson, Mississippi; and Knoxville, Tennessee.  Towards the end of July 1865, he 
	  recounts, the men received orders to prepare mustering-out documents for the regiment, which they did "with a renewed energy," 
	  and he and the rest of his regiment returned to civilian life in August of 1865.  Pease was mustered out as a first lieutenant.</p><p>Pease came to Nebraska in May, 1884, and settled in Armada Township, Buffalo County where he took a soldier's homestead which he eventually expanded to 320 acres.  He was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) veterans' organization and, according to the <emph render="italic">Biographical Souvenir of the Counties of Buffalo, Kearney and Phelps in Nebraska</emph> 
(F.A. Battey and Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1890) was
 "a highly respected citizen in the community."</p><p>[&scrc_name; gratefully acknowledges the assistance of Elisabeth Burns, descendant of B.F. Pease, in the preparation of this biographical sketch.]</p></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Benjamin F. Pease Memoir</emph> recounts the experiences of private, later first lieutenant, Pease as a soldier and 
		 prisoner of war during the American Civil War.  The volume, written at various times between 1901 and 1910, is dedicated to 
		 his grandson, Hazen Teeple.</p>
		 <p>In the book, Pease discusses the struggles, privations, medical conditions, and occasional humor of his service, and 
		 records his observations on the quality of Union officers.  Initially, 
		 he and his fellow soldiers were issued no weapons; the few muskets were used by those on guard, and handed off at the end 
		 of their shift to the next detail.  He recollects his months as a prisoner, discussing medical facilities and practices, 
		 the respect shown to them by Confederate soldiers, and the belligerence of some civilians.</p>
		 <p>The volume is handwritten; also included is a typed transcription.</p>
