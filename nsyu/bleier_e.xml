      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Ed Bleier (1929- ) is an American radio and television executive.  His career has 
		paralleled the history of electronic media, with important roles in "new media" creation 
		for Warner Bros., Warner Communications, and Time Warner.  As of 2007 he was a board 
		member of Blockbuster Inc., CKX Inc, and of RealNetworks, whose focus is streaming media 
		over the Internet.</p>
      <p>Bleier began his professional career with WNEW's "High School Hour" and The Long 
		Island Press.   He wrote for the Syracuse (New York) 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Herald Journal</emph> 
		and for several Syracuse-area radio stations, and managed promotion for the DuMont Television 
		Network and New York's Channel 5.  In the early 1950s, while working at New York's Channel 7 
		and later at ABC, he instituted television-time sales to movie companies.  </p>
      <p>While studying at Syracuse University he worked as a copyboy for ABC News, and by the 
		1960s he was  a senior executive there, having worked as Vice President for Daytime and 
		Children's Programming and Sales; General Sales Management; and Marketing, Public Relations 
		and Strategic Planning.  Among his "firsts" at ABC were the first integration of 
		African-American characters in daytime dramas and establishing ABC's first Saturday morning 
		children's block, built around Warner Bros. Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes cartoons.  Over 40 years 
		he oversaw some 100 variations of Looney Tunes programming on ten different cable and 
		broadcast networks, propelling the characters into the top slots in both television and 
		licensing/retail.</p>
      <p>Bleier left ABC (succeeded there by Disney executive Michael Eisner) to become President 
		of Warner Bros. Domestic Pay-TV, Cable and Network Features division, where he worked closely 
		with Warner's cable systems to develop basic and pay-tv networks including MTV, Nickelodeon, 
		TMC and others; co-created the corporate plan for home video;  drove after-market sales of TV 
		series and feature films to record-breaking levels; and pioneered new digital media markets 
		such as content-on-demand and pay-per-view.  From 2002 to 2005, Bleier served as Senior 
		Adviser to the company.  </p>
      <p>In 2003 Bleier wrote the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> best-seller  
		
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">The Thanksgiving Ceremony</emph>, a work which grew out of his own 
		first-generation American experiences (the book's foreword was written by well-known 
		columnist and Syracuse University alumnus William Safire).</p>
      <p>Bleier's 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">pro bono</emph> work has included serving as steering 
		committee chairman for 13 of the Aspen Institute's Communications Leaders Conferences, 
		meetings which encourage dialogue between the communications industry's senior creative and 
		business executives and their counterparts in government, economics and science.  He was 
		chairman of the Center for Communication, President of the International Radio and Television 
		Society, Vice-Chairman of the International Television Council, Chairman of the Academy of 
		the Arts of East Hampton's Guild Hall, and a former board member of the Keystone Center for 
		Science and Environment and the Martha Graham Dance Company.  He has participated in two 
		United Nations World TV Forums and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a 
		trustee of the Charles Dana Foundation.</p>
