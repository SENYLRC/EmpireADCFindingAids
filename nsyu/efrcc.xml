      <p>Syracuse University's Film Rental Center was a lending library of 16mm films.   The date the Center was established is unknown, as is the date it ceased operations, but according to information found in the Syracuse University Archives, in 1965 the Center was operating out of a building at 1455 East Colvin Street.   According to a 1978 article in the Syracuse Post-Standard, it offered "[m]ore than 10,000 titles, mostly educational films...at rental fees ranging from $5 to $100" (Syracuse <emph render="italic">Post-Standard</emph>, Nov. 10, 1978, p. 26).      The Center may at one time have been affiliated with the School of Education (records are incomplete).  Eventually the films (or at least some of them) were transferred to the Media Collection at the University's E. S. Bird Library on Waverley Ave.   In 2016 these 28 films were transferred to &scrc_name;; the fate of the rest of the collection is unknown.</p></bioghist>
