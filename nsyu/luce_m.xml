      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Marian S. Burroughs, known professionally as Molly Luce, was born on December 18, 
1896, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and in 
Plainfield and Glen Ridge, New Jersey, and spent summers with her grandparents in 
Kinsville, Ohio. Upon completing high school in 1914, Molly Luce began further studies 
at Wheaton College, where she earned an associate's degree. Beginning in 1916, at the 
Art Student's League in New York, Ms. Luce studied under, along with other 
distinguished faculty, Kenneth Hayes Miller. In addition to teaching his students to paint, 
Molly Luce writes that Miller "taught, first of all respect for painting as an occupation 
and appreciation of the place held by professional artists." In her unpublished 
autobiography, Ms. Luce expresses frequently the concern that artists be taken seriously 
as professionals and speaks especially of the difficulties encountered by women working 
in the fine arts. In 1922, she began a tour of Europe which took her through France, 
Switzerland and Italy. Molly Luce developed into an important painter of 'The American 
Scene' and D. Roger Howlett, of Childs Gallery in Boston, feels that the time she spent in 
Italy "helped to bring together her training and consciousness of 'place' that were to stay 
with her for her career." While her contemporaries were heading in more abstract 
directions, at an artist's colony in St. Paul du Var and in Paris Molly Luce began to 
solidify her commitment to "realistic as opposed to abstract art." Shortly after returning to 
the United States in 1924, her first publicly exhibited painting was hung in the Whitney 
Studio Club, New York; her first one-woman show opened at the Club later the same 
year. From then until 1950 her paintings were featured in prominent museums and 
galleries all over the United States.</p>
      <p>In 1966 twenty Luce paintings were featured at a one-woman show celebrating the 50th 
anniversary of the graduation of the class of 1916 (A) from Wheaton College, and a 
major traveling retrospective of paintings from 1917-1980 was organized by the Childs 
Gallery, Boston, in 1980.</p>
      <p>In 1926 Molly Luce married Alan Burroughs, painter and art historian, associated with 
the Fogg Museum at Harvard. Mr. Burroughs pioneered in the use of X-ray technology in 
the examination of art works and archeological artifacts. They lived in the Boston area 
during the early years of their marriage and spent summers, beginning in the thirties, in 
Little Compton, Rhode Island. In 1942 the lure of life in Little Compton drew them 
full-time and Molly Luce lives there to this day. Alan Burroughs died in 1965. The name 
of Molly's stepson, Bruce Burroughs, appears once, on a family card and there is a brother, Clark, some of 
whose letters appear in the collection. Other than these two names, no other family 
information could be found.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Molly Luce Collection</emph> is divided into sections as follows: Biographical material, 
Clippings, Correspondence, Exhibition catalogs, Photographs of Molly Luce paintings, 
Printed reproductions of Molly Luce paintings, Writings and Miscellanea.</p>
      <p>There are four 
        
        <emph render="bold">Biographical</emph> items: three issues of the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Wheaton College Alumni Quarterly</emph> 
(May '34, May '42 &amp; Fall '65) and an issue of

        
        <emph render="italic">The Arts</emph> (August '25). The purchase of a Molly Luce painting ("Beach at high tide") in 
1934 by the Metropolitan Museum caused a substantial stir in art circles because it was 
most unusual for such a prestigious institution to purchase (1) an American work, (2) by a 
woman artist. The 1934 issue of the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Wheaton Quarterly</emph> reports on this event. There is an 
interview with the artist in the '42 issue and a photo and brief biographical sketch in the 
'65 issue. The August, 1925 issue of 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Arts</emph> ran an enthusiastic review of Mrs. Luce's 
work by Alan Burroughs, written a year after the artist's first one-woman show at the 
Whitney Club. Luce and Burroughs were married a year later.</p>
      <p>Four folders of newspaper 
        
        <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph> span five decades of activity, with an emphasis on 
the years between 1927 and 1945, and consist of exhibition announcements and critical 
comment by reviewers.  
</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> consists of  a series of letters written by the artist to Alan Burroughs while on a trip 
to California in 1939, valuable for the insight they offer into Molly Luce's personality and her relationship with 
her husband. From 1965 there are letters of condolence from friends and 
associates on the death of Mr. Burroughs. The rest of the correspondence is chiefly letters 
from a friend, Poddie (Mrs. Philip Souers) and her Brother, Clark, reporting on family 
news.</p>
      <p>The folder of 
        
        <emph render="bold">Exhibition catalogs</emph> offers a chronological overview of the artist's life and 
work. Some of them, most notably the 1980
Childs Gallery catalog, contain biographical information in a condensed format, along 
with stylistic analysis. Her unpublished autobiography is
quoted extensively.</p>
      <p>There are sixty-two black-and-white 8 x 10 
        
        <emph render="bold">Photographs of Molly Luce paintings</emph>, six of 
which have smaller color photos attached to them. Each large photo carries the title of the 
work, the size, date of completion and sometimes the price it sold for and to whom. It is 
very unfortunate that the collection has so few color reproductions of Molly Luce's work.</p>
      <p>Molly Luce's paintings have appeared as 
        
        <emph render="bold">Reproductions</emph> in a wide variety of media.
The next folder contains seven examples: a Christmas card, illustrations for four 
magazine articles, a book jacket and a small printed reproduction. Some are in color, 
helpful in gaining an idea of painter's preferred palette.</p>
      <p>The backbone of the collection -- found in 
        
        <emph render="bold">Writings</emph> -- is Molly Luce's autobiography, offering in-depth background 
information on every aspect of the artist's life, training and philosophy. 
        
        <emph render="italic">An Artist's Angle</emph> is 
divided into three parts: Student painter, Intermission in productivity and Artist painter. 
Following a brief sketch of her background and early childhood, Ms. Luce concentrates 
on her educational experiences at Wheaton and the Art Student's League. H. Roger 
Howlett points out in the 1980 Childs Gallery exhibition catalog that it is significant, 
considering how Molly Luce's style developed, that she spent her summers so happily in 
the peaceful countryside in Ohio. Critical commentary is offered on the education and 
training of Fine Artists and on some of her own teachers. Further along, the 
autobiography articulates clearly some of the obstacles she encountered as a woman 
trying to make her way in a male dominated field in the 1920's, 30's and 40's.</p>
      <p>Molly Luce exhibited her first one-woman show at the Whitney Club in November of 
1924, and immediately thereafter "fell into an artistic depression." Her progress through 
this slump and the directions her career took when the misery lifted comprise the second 
and third sections of the book. The depression did lift and the balance of her book details 
the paths her career took and the lines along which her feelings developed concerning the 
whole world of Fine Arts.</p>
      <p>A small amount of 
        
        <emph render="bold">Miscellany</emph> completes the collection.</p>
