      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>James Albert Pike (1913-1969) was an American clergyman, lawyer, and author.  He wrote and spoke extensively on the church and social problems, Christian and legal ethics, pastoral psychology, psychical research, and spiritualism.</p>
      <p>Pike was born February 14th, 1913 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to James A. Pike and Pearl Agatha Wimsatt Pike.  After his father died he moved to California with his mother where he graduated from Hollywood High School in 1930 and attended the Santa Clara University for two years.  From 1932-1933 he attended the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), then transferred to the University of Southern California (USC), where he received his BA in 1934 and an LLB from the university's law school in 1936.  That same year he was admitted to the California bar.</p>
      <p>Pike received a Sterling Fellowship and spent part of 1936-1937 studying for a doctorate in law at Yale, where he was awarded the JSD in 1938.  He served as an expert in federal procedure at Catholic University Law School (1938-1939) and in civil procedures at George Washington University Law School (1939-1942), then with a fellow lawyer he established the law firm of Pike and Fischer, specializing in the publication of books on federal judicial and administrative procedure.</p>
      <p>Pike married Jane Alvies in Los Angeles on August 14, 1938.  They separated at the beginning of 1940 and were divorced in October 1941.   On January 29, 1942, he married Esther Yanovsky, whom he had met while she was attending his law class at George Washington.  He and Esther had four children: Catherine, James Jr., Constance, and Christopher.</p>
      <p>In 1942 Pike joined the Office of Naval Intelligence and later sought and received a commission as Lieutenant (jg) in the Naval Reserve.  In 1943 he was accepted as a postulant in the Protestant Episcopal Church.  In 1944 he moved to the United States Maritime Commission, War Shipping Administration, but then requested and received inactive duty status due to his ordination as deacon in December of that year.  His first appointment in the Church was as curate at St. John's Church in Washington.  At the same time, he served as chaplain to Episcopal students at George Washington and studied at Virginia Theological Seminary.</p>
      <p>In 1946 he left Washington to become a fellow and tutor at the General Theological Seminary in New York, and a few months later (November 1, 1946) he was ordained to the priesthood of the Protestant Episcopal Church.  In 1947 he was appointed rector of Christ Church in Poughkeepsie, New York; he also served as chaplain to students at Vassar College.  In 1949 he became chaplain at Columbia University in New York; together with Professor Ursula Niebuhr he established Columbia's Department of Religion.</p>
      <p>In 1952 Pike became Dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, where he made the pulpit a place for discussion of the religious and social problems of the day.  He became known as a spokesman for liberal Protestantism and in 1955 was invited by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) to host a series television programs.  In 1956 he participated in a trip to Israel  to study and report on Arab refugee problems, and in 1957 he was appointed to the Zellerbach Commission, which studied refugee issues across Europe.</p>
      <p>He was selected bishop-coadjutor by the annual convention of the diocese of California and consecrated to the position May 15, 1958; later that year, following the death of Bishop Karl Morgan Block, he became the fifth Bishop of California.  He held the position for seven years, until he resigned in 1965 after a sabbatical at Cambridge. Shortly thereafter (1966) he joined the staff at the Center for Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, where he established a foundation to aid people experiencing a transition in their religious lives and began an extensive schedule of speaking engagements.</p>
      <p>A series of inexplicable events following the suicide of Pike's son James Jr. in 1966 convinced Pike  that his son was attempting to communicate with h


im from beyond the grave, and he turned his investigative attention to the field of psychic phenomena.  This capped an increasingly contentious career, as Pike's outspoken views on theological and social issues (including ordination of women, racial desegregation, and acceptance of lesbians and gays within mainline churches) had already disturbed his fellow clergy. Pike was charged with heresy three times (though the charges were dropped) and was formally censured by his fellow Bishops in October of 1966.</p>
      <p>In 1967 Pike and Esther were divorced and Pike married Diane Kennedy, who had been his assistant at the foundation and who had helped him complete a book on psychic phenomena.  In early 1969 Pike announced that he and his wife were officially ending their connection with the Episcopal Church in particular and with all forms of organized religion in general.   Pike's continued interest in the early Christian church led him and Diane on a research trip to Israel in 1969 where they were lost on an expedition into the desert between Jerusalem and the Red Sea.  Diane found her way to safety but Pike's body was found  by a search party.  He was buried at Jaffa in Israel on September 8, 1969.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        
        
        
        
        <emph render="bold">James Albert Pike Papers</emph> consist of correspondence, professional records, 
memorabilia, financial and legal records, writings, and miscellany.  The collection is comprised of two separate segments which have not been physically integrated; however, they are listed logically in the inventory.  For this reason, box numbers sometimes occur out of order in the inventory.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> covers the years 1889-1970.  The early correspondence, 1889-1904, consists of letters from Pike's father to his mother (Pike's 
grandmother) and sister (Pike's aunt). There is a large amount of 
correspondence between Pike and many of his relatives during the period 1952-1958. Some of this correspondence contains important genealogical information. 
Especially interesting is a series of letters between Pike and a cousin, 
Sister Agnes Marie, a Roman Catholic nun, which contain his reflections on his 
own religious development beyond what he received from his Catholic 
background. However, there is very little correspondence with his wives and 
children.</p>
      <p>There are a number of important groups of correspondence and some noteworthy 
individual letters. These include letters relating to: Pike's 
controversy with the Vassar religion department over the teaching of the 
Christian faith, 1949-1950; his refusal of an honorary degree from the 
University of the South, 1953; the organization and construction and 
administration of the Chapel of Saint James the Fisherman, Wellfleet, 
Massachusetts, 1952-1961; the controversy over the treaty with Spain which 
included a restriction on the freedom of United States service personnel to 
marry Spanish women, 1954; the controversy over the sermon which criticized 
Senator Joseph McCarthy, 1954; the work of the Rev. G. Michael Scott at the 
United Nations regarding South West Africa, 1952-1957; the issue of the Arab 
refugees and the Middle East, 1953-1957; his sermon on the movie 
        
        
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Baby Doll</emph> 
1956-1957; the issue of the alleged religious quota system in the assignment 
of probation officers in New York City, 1957; his threatened suit against the 
Manchester, New Hampshire 
        
        
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Union</emph>, 1957; the charges of heresy against him, 
1966-1967; and the question of psychic phenomena, 1967-1969. Also of interest 
is a series of correspondence with the Harry Walker Agency relating to that 
organization's handling of the scheduling of Pike's speaking engagements and 
to the problems caused by his decision, late in 1967, to reduce the number of 
his appearances. Scattered throughout are groups of correspondence related to 
his various articles, books, sermons, and speeches, as well as pastoral 
letters counseling people on matters of divorce and mixed marriages, which 
have been restricted. After 1965 the bulk of the correspondence is of the "fan 
mail" variety, and most of it deals either with the charges of heresy or with 
psychic phenomena. A selected group of correspondence relating to his speaking 
engagements during this period has been included. At the end of the 
correspondence are a number of notebooks, 1955-1958, which contain carbon 
copies of his replies to correspondence as well as carbon copies of some 
inter-office memoranda.</p>
      <p>Among individual pieces of correspondence which are of interest are: a letter 
dated February 24, 1947 in which the Rev. John Hines, later Presiding Bishop 
of the Protestant Episcopal Church, invites Pike to become the Episcopal 
religion professor at the University of Texas; letters dated June 19, 1966 to 
K. Greenleaf Pedley, and October 18, 1967 to Robert Marshall, in which Pike 
gives his views on the Qumran community and comments on his research into 
Christian origins; a letter dated March 16, 1967 to Emil Oberholzer in which 
he details his views on the taxation of churches; a detailed memo from William 
Stringfellow dated August 1967 which discusses possible strategies for the 
general convention in Seattle; a letter dated Nov 3, 1968 from Mrs. Paul 
Tillich, in which she criticizes Pike for involving her husband's name in 
accounts of his experiences with psychic phenomena; and a letter to J. Richard 
Lander dated April 5, 1969 in which he recounts some of the events surrounding 
his first marriage.</p>

        <emph render="bold">Financial and legal records</emph> contains agreements relating to book publication, 
bank statements and check books for both the bishop's discretionary fund and 
special account, contracts for speaking engagements, and the divorce papers of 
Pike's first divorce.</p><p>
        <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> consists in large part of biographical materials, including newspaper 
clippings, various sermons and papers by others dealing with Pike's opinions 
and their significance, photographs, and programs of events in which he 
participated, and five large scrapbooks containing newspaper clippings.</p><p>
        <emph render="bold">Personal records</emph> 
contains Pike's birth certificate, along with personal correspondence, personal financial and legal material, and material on the Pike family.  There is also a small amount pertaining to Pike's son James Pike, Jr.</p><p>
        <emph render="bold">Professional records</emph> consist of materials relating to Pike's 
professional career and are subdivided according to the chronological sequence 
of that career: lawyer, 1936-1944; curate, 1944-1946; rector, 1947-1949; 
chaplain, 1949-1952; dean, 1952-1958; bishop, 1958-1966; resigned bishop, 
1966-1969.  Materials of special interest in this series include the following: copies of the Christian 
education materials which he helped to introduce at St. John's Church in 
Washington, D. C.; drafts of reports and statements relating to the Vassar and 
Sewanee controversies; certificates of consent to Pike's election as bishop, 
as well as tally sheets of the votes of the election and materials relating to 
the preparations for the consecration; memoranda, pastoral letters, and 
directives related to the administration of the diocese of California, 
particularly a memorandum from Pike to an unidentified strategy committee and 
a position paper of that committee; materials related to the discussion of the 
status of deaconesses at the meeting of the House of Bishops in Glacier Park, 
Montana; materials relating to the heresy charges and the meeting of the House 
of Bishops in Wheeling, West Virginia, particularly the transcripts of tapes 
made by the C. B. C.; releases, memos, statements, and resolutions from the 
General Convention in Seattle, Washington; a proposal to buy 
        
        
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">The Churchman</emph>;
an organizational affiliation card file; and notes and questions from two 
speaking engagements.</p><p><emph render="bold">Recordings</emph> contains more than a hundred audio and video recordings of speeches, interviews, lectures, television appearances, sermons, and so on.  Also included here is a recording of an episode of the television series "In Search Of" which focused on Pike and his disappearance in Egypt.</p>
      
      
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Writings</emph> consists of articles, book reviews, books, columns, 
forewords, interviews, memoranda, radio and television transcripts, sermons, 
speeches, and miscellaneous.  Dates are given when known.</p>
      <p>Among the books, 
        
        
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">The Next Day</emph> appears to have originated as a collection of 
sermons, and the original draft seems merely to consist of copies of those 
sermons. The next draft is apparently made up entirely of fragments from the 
first effort to put them into some continuous order. The drafts of Chapters 1 
through 3 of 
        
        
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">The Other Side</emph> have been arranged as nearly as possible in the 
sequence in which they were written. It appears that after the book was begun 
the concept of its composition was changed and material which had been grouped 
together was separated into what eventually became the first three chapters. 
The first draft of the section of 
        
        
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Selected Readings On The Legal Profession</emph> 
which Pike edited consists mainly of published material annotated so as to 
indicate material to be included in that section. Of interest among the drafts 
of 
        
        
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Teen-agers and Sex</emph> are drafts of chapters which have been annotated by an 
unknown reader.</p>
      <p>The columns consist mainly of drafts of the "Dean's Column" from the 
        
        
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Bulletin 
of the diocese of New York</emph>. Of interest also are drafts of a proposed 
syndicated newspaper column in which Pike would have answered questions 
submitted to him by readers. The interviews are in the form either of drafts 
submitted to Pike for his approval, transcripts from tapes of the interview, 
or published material. Of significance here is a transcript of the interview 
of Pike and Arthur Ford on Canadian television by Alan Spraggett. Legal 
memoranda and memoranda submitted to the staff of the Center for their 
discussion and as proposals for further investigation constitute the section 
on memoranda.</p>
      <p>The sermons are in large part mimeographed publicity releases by the Cathedral 
of St. John the Divine containing excerpts from or summaries of Pike's 
sermons. Since most of his preaching was done extemporaneously, and, 
apparently, without notes, most of this material consists of either prepared 
statements or transcriptions of tapes. However, there are some notes of 
sermons which date from the earlier part of his ministry. Many of these are 
arranged together in folders which cover a number of years,
since the specific dates of their delivery are unknown. The speeches also 
consist in large measure of excerpts or summaries or transcriptions of 
material given extemporaneously.</p>
      <p>Miscellaneous writings include the position paper written by Pike for 
presentation to the Bayne Committee, what appear to be papers written for 
courses which he had taken, as well as letters to the editor, press releases, 
and other types of public comment on various issues.</p>
      <p>The collection concludes with a small amount of <emph render="bold">Writings by others</emph>, 1923-1970.  This  consists of writings of others arranged 
alphabetically by author. Included are published materials containing 
annotations by Pike or by the author to Pike, and papers written by students 
in Pike's classes.</p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="351$a">
      <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
      <p>Correspondence is arranged chronologically, with incoming 
correspondence stapled on top of outgoing; a small amount of undated 
correspondence is placed at the beginning.  Professional records are arranged chronologically, grouped by positions held (e.g., lawyer, 1936-1944; curate, 1944-1946; etc); within these general headings the materials are arranged 
alphabetically by type and subject.  Memorabilia is arranged alphabetically by type of material; the oversize scrapbooks have been placed at the end of the collection.  Financial and legal records are arranged alphabetically according 
to the type of material.</p>
      <p>Writings are arranged alphabetically by type and within that alphabetically by title, except for book reviews, forewords, and sermons.   Book reviews and forewords are arranged 
alphabetically by the author of the book reviewed or the book for which the 
foreword was written, while sermons are arranged chronologically by the date 
on which they were delivered.  Untitled materials at the end of each section are arranged alphabetically 
by subject matter.</p>
