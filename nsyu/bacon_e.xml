      <p>Ernst Bacon (1898-1990) was an American composer, pianist, conductor, chamber musician, and teacher.  For much of his teaching career he was Director of the School of Music at Syracuse University.    </p>

        <emph render="italic">A Drumlin Legend</emph>, 
commissioned by the Ditson Fund and premiered at the Columbia University 
Festival of Contemporary Music; his orchestral suite, 
        
        <emph render="italic">From These States</emph>, in

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Ernst Bacon Papers</emph> consists of three separate 
		accessions.  The researcher is advised to explore the entire inventory to ensure locating all relevant material.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="underline">Main collection</emph>
      </p>
      <p>The main collection consists of four series: correspondence, musical manuscripts, literary manuscripts, 
and published material.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> is arranged chronologically, apart from a few notable correspondents foldered separately.  Notable correspondents in the chronological material inlude John Alden Carpenter,
Kay Boyle,
Aaron Copland,
Witter Bynner, and
Van Wyck Brooks.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Manuscripts</emph> is subdivided into material relating to <emph render="italic">Songs from 
Emily Dickinson</emph>, 
        
        material relating to <emph render="italic">A Tree on the Plains</emph>, and general music scores.

        
        Material relating to <emph render="italic">Songs from Emily Dickinson</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="italic">A Tree on the Plains</emph> is further subdivided into 
bound and unbound manuscripts; this in turn is further broken down into the types of 
manuscripts, such as orchestral, piano, songs, et cetera.  General music scores 
is arranged by type or instrument for which the music was written (Cello &amp; piano, choral, contrapuntal studies, opera, orchestral, 
piano, sketch books, sketches, and songs) and within that, alphabetically by title.  When several scores were bound together or appeared in folio form, the title of 
the first piece was used for an alphabetical arrangement.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Literary manuscripts</emph> consists of addresses (radio), articles, books 
and plays, arranged alphabetically by title. All but one are typescript, although 
Bacon's handwritten corrections appear on many of the typescripts.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Published materials</emph> consists of articles, booklets, clippings and so on about and by 
Ernst Bacon. Material is subdivided by type.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="underline">Additions: University Archives</emph>
      </p>
      <p>Two separate groupings of material were transferred from University Archives in 1991.  The first grouping consists of Compositions and Writings.  The second grouping consists of Artwork, Compositions, Writings, and Memorabilia (awards and photographs).</p><p>The bulk of this material remains in original order as received, and therefore is not consistently arranged.  Some of this material duplicates items in other parts of the collection.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="underline">Additions: Don Siebert</emph>
      </p>
      <p>A small amount of material, consisting of  various scores and one essay, was donated to the
        collection in 1993 by Don Siebert, who was for more than forty years the Music Librarian for Syracuse University Libraries.  Some of this material duplicates items in other parts of the collection.</p>
