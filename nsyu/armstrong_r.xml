      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Robb Armstrong (1962- ) is a Black American cartoonist, author, and speaker, best known for his long-running daily comic strip 
		<emph render="italic">Jump Start</emph>.</p>
		
		<p>Armstrong cites <emph render="italic">Peanuts</emph> cartoonist Charles Schulz as one of his early inspirations; 
		he and Schulz eventually met and became close friends.  While a student at Syracuse University, Armstrong created a 
		popular comic strip for the student newspaper, the <emph render="italic">Daily Orange</emph>.  His daily strip 
		<emph render="italic">Jump Start</emph>, originated in 1989, is syndicated in hundreds of American newspapers, including the 
		<emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph> and the <emph render="italic">Chicago Sun-Times</emph>.  Armstrong 
		is one of the very few Black syndicated cartoonists in the United States.</p>
		
		<p><emph render="italic">Jump Start</emph> centers on the daily lives of the Cobbs, a middle-class Black 
		family -- Joe, a city police officer; his wife Marcy, a nurse; and their children Sunny, Jojo, Tommi and Teddy.   
		A large supporting cast of extended family, friends, and co-workers make regular appearances, including Joe's mother 
		Dot (a retired English teacher), Marcy's mother Maureen (whose second husband Clayton is a tiny man with twelve very 
		large sons), and Joe's colleague "Crunchy." The cast also includes a mixed-race couple, Clarence and Charlene.  
		Although Armstrong does tackle serious issues, including homelessness, racism, and violence, in the strip, he does 
		so with humor and compassion rather than anger:  "That's not what this world needs. My friends don't need to hear how 
		outraged I am. I have to be part of the cure."</p>
		
		<p>Although best known for <emph render="italic">Jump Start</emph>, Armstrong has also written children's books as 
		well as <emph render="italic">Fearless: A Cartoonist's Guide to Life</emph>.  He has received numerous awards and 
		accolades for his work, including a Distinguished Alumni Award from Shipley University, an honorary degree from Holy 
		Family University in Pennsylvania, and the Wilbur Award from the Religious Public Relations Council.  He  is active 
		in encouraging young people to set high goals, serving as a visiting professor at the Savannah College of Art and 
		Design and speaking at numerous colleges and universities as well as the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian 
		Institution.</p>
