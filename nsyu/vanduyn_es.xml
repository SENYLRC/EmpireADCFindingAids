      <p>Edward Seguin Van Duyn (1872-1955) was an American physician from Syracuse, New York.   His father John Van Duyn, also a physician in Syracuse, gave his son the middle name "Seguin" in honor of Édouard Séguin, a French physician who emigrated to New York and was known for his work with the mentally handicapped.    Edward S. Van Duyn graduated from Princeton University and 
		received his M.D. at Syracuse University in 1897.  He was a military surgeon during World War I with the American Expeditionary Force, a professor of clinical surgery at Syracuse University Medical School,   a practicing physician in Syracuse for many years, 
		and president of the board of managers of the Syracuse State 
		Institution for the Feeble Minded.  </p></bioghist>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Edward S. Van Duyn World War I Collection</emph> includes correspondence, photographs, 
			scrapbooks and a history of U.S. Army Base Hospital #31.  The material relates to two separate 
			trips to France.  The first was in 1916, before the United States entered the war, when Van Duyn 
			joined a group of volunteer American doctors who went to France to help care for the wounded.  
			The second, in 1918, was with a Syracuse hospital unit that served American forces in France.</p>
			
			<p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> contains incoming correspondence, most of it 
			relating to hospital work but also a few personal notes.</p>
			<p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> contains photographs, postcards, scrapbooks and other 
			items.  Some of the photographs and postcards are annotated on the back with names or places and 
			others not.  Included here are photographs of Edward Van Duyn and of his father John Van Duyn, 
			also a physician. Official documents include passports and military identification cards and 
			documents, in both French and English. Personal documents include clippings, a course schedule 
			for Syracuse University College of Medicine for 1917-1918, business and trade cards, programs 
			and tickets from events, and other items.</p>
			
			<p>The most significant items of memorabilia are two scrapbooks, one from each of Van Duyn's 
			tours in France.  Both contain photographs, postcards, clippings, letters, notes, and other items 
			relating to the physicians and nurses of the Hospital Unit G and their experiences. The second, 
			from the 1918 tour, is extensively annotated by Van Duyn with names, dates, events, and memories.  
			Included in this scrapbook is a two-page spread on Armistice Day, with notes relating how Van 
			Duyn and another officer tried to get to the battle field that day, crossing through Verdun ("a 
			city of the dead") and crawling in and out of abandoned German trenches where they found 
			"half-eaten meals, abandoned personnel belongings, guns and dead bodies."  Photographs, both 
			originals and in the form of postcards, include 
			hospitals, ambulances, and surgery wards; ruined houses and landscapes; officers, doctors and 
			nurses both on duty and at leisure; and more.  A few negatives show a group of men standing 
			around a crashed biplane.</p>
			<p><emph render="bold">Writings</emph> contains Van Duyn's diary containing notes on his 
			experiences, specifically relating to medical practice in wartime; a three-page typescript 
			describing in vivid detail the sounds heard at night near the front; and a published history of Army Base Hospital No. 31 stamped on the cover with Van Duyn's name in gold.  This last item has 
			been transferred to Rare Books for cataloging, but a photocopy of the cover and title page 
			remains in the collection.</p>
