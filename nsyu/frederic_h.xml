      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Harold Frederic (1856-1898) was an American journalist and novelist who served as the London correspondent for the



        <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>.</p>
      <p>Harold Frederic was born on August 19, 1856 in Utica, New York to Henry Frederick and Frances Ramsdell Frederick. His father, a railroad conductor, was tragically killed in a railroad accident when Harold was eighteen months old.  Frederic spent his youth working on his step father's dairy farm.  Around 1876, Frederic joined the Utica



        <emph render="italic">Daily Observer</emph> as a reporter. He worked his way up to editor and by 1882 he was asked to be editor-in-chief of the



        <emph render="italic">Albany Evening Journal</emph>. When the paper was sold in 1884 Frederic left for London to serve as the London correspondent of the



        <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>.
</p>
      <p>Frederic married Grace Williams on October 10, 1877.  Together they had two daughters, Ruth and Ruby, and three sons, Harold (d. 1887), Hereward, and Harold.  In 1890, Frederic took Kate Lyon as his mistress. Since his wife, Grace, refused a divorce, Frederic began supporting two families in 1891.  In addition to the five children from his marriage, Frederic had three children with Lyon. Frederic suffered a stroke in August 1898, leaving him partially paralyzed.  He died October 19, 1898 at the age of 42.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The



        <emph render="bold">Harold Frederic Letters</emph> consist of six outgoing items written between 1893 and 1898. There are three letters to Charles Dayton, who was responsible for guarding his legal interests in America while Frederic was abroad. The earliest letter offers Dayton congratulations on his appointment by Grover Cleveland as Postmaster of New York City. The other two items are of a business nature, the latest seeking advice about referring his legal affairs to another firm:




        <blockquote>
          <p>
The Kernan-Quin office contains a lot of friends of mine, young as well as old, and I have thought of them as being likely to take hold of the thing with avidity, and watch it sharply. But of course I could not dream of speaking to them till I had consulted you. God knows what rules of bar-etiquette I may not have broken in the process of this consultation, but I know you will comprehend that none of the old and good ties of our friendship, have been strained by a hairsbreadth.
</p>

      <p>The remainder of the correspondence (Baxter, Forman, Gilliams) concerns arrangements for social engagements.</p>
