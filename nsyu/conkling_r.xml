      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Roscoe Conkling (1829-1888) was an American lawyer and United States Senator and 
		Representative.  Conkling came from a political family; his father Alfred Conkling, was a 
		U.S. Representative and Federal judge and his brother Frederick was also a U.S. 
		Representative.   Conkling practiced law both before and after his time in Washington, 
		served as Oneida County District Attorney, and declined to accept a nomination to the 
		United States Supreme Court in 1882.   During more than twenty years in Congress 
		(1859-1882) he was a Radical Republican, and was active in framing and pushing through 
		Congress Reconstruction legislation and the second Civil Rights Act in 1875.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The Roscoe Conkling Letters are a collection of 27 outgoing items written between 
		1863 and 1864 by the Utica attorney and United States congressman.  An active participant 
		in Republican Party politics at both the state and national levels, throughout the 
		correspondence Conkling demonstrates his loyalty to candidates as well as those who 
		worked to secure their election.  Writing to H.S. Solomon (21 Jun 1872), Conkling 
		regrets that he is unable to attend a meeting to ratify the Republican national nominees, 
		but states:</p><blockquote><p>My belief is that Grant &amp; Wilson will receive more 
		electoral votes than have been given to any President &amp; Vie President, with one 
		exception, for thirty years, and that New York will give them a larger majority than 
		any other state.</p><p>President Grant is stronger with the people now, than he was 
		four years ago - he gains greatly from the scandalous assaults made upon him, and from 
		want of confidence on all sides in the movement against him.</p>
		<p>Thorough discussion, 
		a full presentation of the truth, from now till November, must it seems to me leave the 
		case the clearest ever submitted to the American people.</p></blockquote>
    <p>In the midst of another election campaign in 1877, Conkling writes "confidential" 
	 letters to Republican Party workers John N. Knapp of Auburn and Isaac Schemerhorn of 
	 Buffalo, advising them of the importance of getting voters to the polls (13 Oct 1877):</p>
	 <blockquote><p>The judgment of tried Republicans from many states impresses me afresh 
	 with the importance of this election in our State, and I am able to assure you in 
	 confidence that if Republicans come out and vote we shall carry the Legislature and the 
	 State ticket by a decided majority.</p>
	 <p>...<emph render="underline">a full Republican 
	 vote means a full victory</emph>...</p>
	 <p>If you and other discreet friends knew what is 
	 known to me there would not be a vote left at home in any town in your County.</p>
	 <p>I trust this hint will lead you to increased action, <emph render="underline">and 
	 action will not fail this year</emph>.</p></blockquote>
	 <p>Conkling's letters are best 
	 characterized by his use of discretion.  With the abuses of public trust symbolized by 
	 Tammany Hall never far from the minds of the voters as well as the press, Conkling was 
	 aware of the need for propriety in the conduct of elected officials.  Approached for 
	 support by Thomas Gold Alvord, Conkling writes (7 Dec 1871):</p>
	 <blockquote><p>With or 
	 without regard to the organization of the Legislature, I shall not hesitate to say any 
	 of the many good things which I believe to be true of you, whenever or wherever they may 
	 appropriately be said.</p><p>So much should I deem only just to any friend whatever my 
	 judgment might be of the wisest selection for any place in or out of the Legislature.</p>
	 </blockquote><p>In a subsequent letter to Alvord, Conkling registers an awareness of 
	 possible charges of impropriety (14 Dec 1878):</p>
	 <blockquote><p>Trusting that the 
	 'Journal' will not know that we are in correspondence, lest it should suspect you of 
	 unsafe and improper associations</p></blockquote>
	 <p>Similarly, Conkling was often 
	 approached by voters and colleagues with recommendations for various appointments (David 
	 S. Bennett, E.M. Madden), and while he is always cordial and polite in the face of such 
	 suggestions, this answer to I.M. Schemerhorn is typical (7 Mar 1871):</p><blockquote>
	 <p>For myself, with none but kind feelings for you, I must in this, as I do in all cases, 
	 abstain from making promises in advance as to my action in regard to applications for 
	 office, to be acted upon in future.  You may however as I have often said, rest assured 
	 that I shall not forget your wish, and shall never act from any motive unfriendly to you.</p></blockquote>
	 <p>In other letters, Conkling refers to sending copies of a speech he delivered on the 
	 "arms question" (Henry J. Cookinham, Schemerhorn), and in a single item to Edward Chase 
	 Ingersoll, he outlines the terms of a joint real estate transaction.</p></scopecontent>
