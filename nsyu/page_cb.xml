      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Charlotte Browning Page (1868-1951) was a teacher in New York State.  She was born November 20, 1868 in Earlville, 
New York, the only child of Katherine and Caleb S. Page.  The Pages operated a farm produce and supply business on the 
Chenango Canal.  After the canal closed in 1878 the family business declined and financial difficulties forced Caleb 
to leave town.  He went to work for a circulating library company in various parts of the South and Midwest; he and 
Charlotte's mother remained separated for the rest of their lives.  Charlotte's mother and maternal 
grandmother, Lucy A. Potter, took in sewing and occasional boarders for a living.</p>

<p>By January 1885 Charlotte, or Charlie as she was known to friends and relatives, was attending the Hamilton (N.Y.) Female 
Seminary conducted by Mr. and Mrs. Goodenough.  After graduating in 1887 she taught school in Hamilton for a year or two, 
then moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where she taught third, fourth, and fifth grades at Bird Elementary School until 1895.  
At that time, Charlotte decided to further her own education by attending the State Normal School at Oneonta, New York.  
She obtained her certificate in 1898 and then taught in Passaic, New Jersey until 1903, when she settled in Tottenville, 
Staten Island, New York.</p>

<p>Charlotte remained in Tottenville until she retired from teaching in the late 1920s and moved back to central New York.  
She died in 1951.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Charlotte Browning Page Collection</emph> consists of correspondence, memorabilia, miscellany, and a few folders of research material.</p>
<p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> is primarily incoming; the only letters written by Charlotte herself are those to her mother and 
grandmother.  The letters to Charlotte are from her mother, father, and various friends and relatives throughout the 
United States, including Los Angeles, Kansas City, Chicago, Providence, Louisville, Victoria (Texas), and Orlando.  The 
personal correspondence reflects the social activities of the times, such as dancing, card parties, boarding schools, church 
functions, courtship, concerts, lectures, theater productions, and boarding house life.  Included in this are accounts 
of the Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1926).  Also recorded here are contemporary tastes in fashion, manners, and 
literature.  The letters trace the advent of innovations like electric lighting, the telephone, public water works, the 
bicycle, the automobile, bobbed hair, and radio.  Correspondence from 1930 to 1941 contain only business letters, most of 
which deal with Charlotte's retirement annuity and dividends from stock holdings.</p><p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> contains a Book of Common Prayer and a postcard scrapbook.</p>



<p><emph render="bold">Miscellaneous</emph> includes Charlotte's household records (bills, receipts, tax forms, and so on), legal and financial documents, and printed material 
(newspaper clippings, her grandmother's obituary, and the New York City flag song.  Also contained here are the minutes 
and treasurer's reports of the Guild of Grade Church (Earlville, New York) from 1902 to 1904.</p>
    <p><emph render="bold">Research material</emph> contains an index on file cards of the major names mentioned in the correspondence.  It also includes 
notes on the correspondence, both chronological and topical, and notes taken from the cemetery records of the Earlville 
Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR).  Some of the relationships on the genealogy charts are guesses based on the 
letters and have not been verified by any official records.  The creator of this research material is unknown; it may have been generated by library staff.</p></scopecontent>
