         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>Charles Rhind Joy (1885-1978) was an American Unitarian minister, author, educator, and international relief worker.  Born in Boston, he studied English at Harvard University and then received degrees from both Harvard Divinity School and Andover Theological Seminary.  His first posting was to First Parish of Portland, Maine where he was ordained in 1913.   A pacifist, during World War I he served overseas with the YMCA, eventually being named Regional Director of YMCA work in France north of Paris and in Western Belgium, with headquarters at Le Havre.  After the war he served as minister of a church in Pittsfield, Massachusetts (1919-1922) and then First Church in Dedham (1922-1927).  </p><p>In January 1927 Joy was appointed minister of All Souls Church in Lowell, Massachusetts, and in 1930 he became an officer of the American Unitarian Association, a position he held until 1937.  In 1938 he joined the Unitarian Service Committee, and from 1940 to 1954 he was involved in international relief work; his positions during this time include executive director of the Unitarian Service Committee, European director and associate director of the Save the Children Federation, international representative, chief of the Korean Mission, and executive consultant for African affairs for C.A.R.E.</p><p>Joy was also an active writer and translator, particularly of the works of Albert Schweitzer.  His publications include <emph render="italic">Albert Schweitzer: An Anthology</emph> (1947), <emph render="italic">Music in the World of Albert Schweitzer</emph> (1951), <emph render="italic">Africa: A Handbook for Travelers</emph> (1958), <emph render="italic">Topical Concordance of the Bible</emph> (1961), and <emph render="italic">Race between food and people: The challenge of a hungry world</emph> (1961).  His translations include <emph render="italic">A Psychiatric Study of Jesus</emph> (Schweitzer) and <emph render="italic">Goethe: Four Studies</emph> (Schweitzer).  He also wrote  numerous introductory books on a wide range of countries and peoples, such as <emph render="italic">Getting to Know the Sahara</emph>, <emph render="italic">Getting to Know Israel</emph>, etc.</p><blockquote><p>I have found all the years to be a rather exciting pilgrimage and never more so than now. I have wandered about the world in more than a hundred different countries and everywhere I have found friendly people with whom it has been good to associate...Traveling, speaking, writing, these are the three foci around which my life now turns. I could not ask for any activities more interesting, more rewarding. I am not much concerned with the past, though I know the future has its roots there. I am eager to see the burgeoning and the fruitage of the years that are to be.</p><p>[Charles R.
