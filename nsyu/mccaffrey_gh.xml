      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>George Herbert McCaffrey (1890-1954) was an American military officer who served during World War II. </p>
	  <p>Born June 2, 1890, McCaffrey attended private schools in the Boston area and received his degree from 
	  Harvard in 1912. During World War I, McCaffrey served overseas and rose to the rank of captain in the 78th 
	  Infantry Regiment.  Returning to civilian life after the war, he continued in the reserves while holding the 
	  post of secretary to the Good Government and Boston Charter Associations from 1919-1929.  In 1927, McCaffrey 
	  accepted a position in New York as assistant director of the Merchants' Association (Commerce and Industry 
	  Association of New York), and the following year became director, a position he held for 22 years.  During 
	  this time, as a lieutenant colonel in the reserves, McCaffrey was assigned to the School of Military Governors 
	  at the University of Virginia.</p>
	  <p>Following the invasion of Sicily in 1942, Lieutenant Colonel McCaffrey was appointed military governor of 
	  the province of Palermo.  His actions at this time supposedly became the inspiration for the character of 
	  Colonel Sartorius in John Hersey's novel, A Bell for Adano.  From Italy, Colonel McCaffrey was transferred 
	  to Vienna to accept a position as senior military government officer and later chief political advisor to 
	  General Mark Clark.  During his tenure in Vienna, McCaffrey improved the condition of the surrounding farm 
	  areas by the introduction of soil-improvement practices.</p>
	  <p>On his return to the United States, and after a brief period as tax consultant to the New York State 
	  Legislature at Albany, Colonel McCaffrey joined the American occupation authorities in Japan as an advisor 
	  on tax reforms.  Later, during the Korean conflict, he was assigned to Puson to take charge of the finance 
	  section of the United Nations Council Administration Commission.</p>
	  <p>He was married to the former Anne Dorothy McElroy, with whom he had three children.</p>
