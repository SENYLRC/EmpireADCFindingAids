         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>Little is known of Gilbert Nettleton other than the evidence given in the letters.  His 
		family was from Newport, New Hampshire, as that is where the letters to his parents 
		and siblings are addressed.   According to Edmund Wheeler's <emph render="italic">The History of Newport from 1766 to 1878</emph>  (Concord:1879), he was born 24 Mar 1808, one of six children of Joel Nettleton (p. 480).  He worked for his father as a clerk in his youth but then "went to Illinois, where he spent the remainder of his life," and married Julia E. Pratt, "a French lady, belonging to a wealthy family" (evidence of the letters suggest that they were married around December of 1839).</p></bioghist>
      
      <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Gilbert Nettleton Letters</emph> consist of ten letters from 
			a young man named Gilbert Nettleton in Illinois to members of his family in Newport, 
			New Hampshire.   Also included in the collection is a commission for Gilbert Nettleton as an Ensign in the 5th Company, 31st Regiment of the New Hampshire Militia.</p><p>Most of the letters are addressed to Gilbert's sisters Elizabeth and Persis; one of them  is from his wife "Juliette."  He was evidently very close to his family, as his affectionate and detailed letters testify.  The letters recount Nettleton's detailed observations on the people, 
			places and society he encounters -- for example, the first letter, sent from Belleville, 
			Illinois, discusses the low level of literacy among the general population and the effects 
			of a lack of education.   Nettleton's high opinion of "the East" is evident, as he often 
			contrasts what he sees in Illinois with what he was accustomed to in New Hampshire.</p>
			
			<p>The letters display a good deal of humor; in one of them he writes, "The town [of 
			Belleville] is well laid out but they have taken no pains to build in any order but 
			<emph render="underline">disorder</emph>, which gives it quite an unfavourable appearance.  
			The revers [sic] might have been the case with a sufficient display of 
			<emph render="underline">Yankee</emph> taste."   Near the end of 1835 Nettleton relocates 
			to Pinckneyville, Illinois, and he soothes his family's concern by writing as follows, in a 
			letter dated 13 Nov 1835:</p><blockquote><p>You appear to express some regret that I should leave where I am, 
			but it appears to be all on account of a fear I may become unsteady.  I will use a 
			<emph render="underline">Commanding Voise</emph> [sic] and say, <emph render="underline">Hush</emph> 
			such visionary fears!   I, become unsteady?  An old man on the wrong side of 24 after 
			cruising about as I have been and not yet shown the first premonitory symptoms?</p></blockquote><p>In the letter of 18 Jun 1840, from Chester, Illinois, he includes greetings from "Juliette," to whom he has been married about seven  months, and in closing he adds that  "the prospects for an addition to my family about 1st Nov next are very flutering [sic]."</p><p></p>
