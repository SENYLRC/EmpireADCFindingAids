         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>M. L. Sears and L.B.R. are unknown.  The letter references Stephen Crane (1871-1900), the well-known American novelist, 
	  and Della Fox (1871-1913), a popular American actress and singer.  Crane died very young of tuberculosis; Fox suffered from 
	  alcohol and drug abuse for much of her life.</p>
	  <p>The phrase "the pace that kills" occurs a number of times in early 20th 
	  century popular media.  One may find examples in a January 23,  1898 editorial in the St Louis 
	  <emph render="italic">Post-Dispatch</emph> (pressures of high society); in an October 22, 1905 
	  <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> article (overwork); in a November 19, 1906 
	  <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> letter to the editor (excessive consumer indulgence); as the caption of a 1907 
	  postcard (picture shows the automobile, but may be a metaphor); in a January 1913 article by the Socialist Party of Great 
	  Britain (automobiles); as the title of a 1928 movie (fast living, drugs, remade in 1935 as 
	  <emph render="italic">The Cocaine Fiends</emph>).</p></bioghist>
      
      <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p><emph render="bold">"The Pace that Kills" Letters</emph> consists of carbon copies of four typed letters exchanged 
		 between M. L. Sears and "L.B.R." (identity unknown).   The first and longest letter, from Sears, is "a sketch  
		 which I commend to your most careful consideration."  The essay -- entitled "The Pace That Kills" and ending with the 
		 initials "W.B." -- concerns the perils of "fast living" (e.g. excessive partying, alchohol, drugs, sexual promiscuity).</p>
		 
		 <blockquote><p>"Once I went to a French ball.  I was very very young, and very very unsophisticated; therefore my paper 
		 sent me to see what I thought of things...I pretended to be rather reluctant.  I said I was afraid, and so I was, but I 
		 was really very much pleased to think how wicked I really was getting to be.  The ball was a great success, so everybody 
		 said.  I had all I could do to keep from crying with disappointment.  The people were so dreadfully dull.  When they 
		 wanted to laugh they drank something, and when they wanted to be witty they kicked someone's hat off or hit an 
		 inoffensive person in the face with a broken fan.  Faugh....I've known them and seen them, many of these people who 
		 goes the pace that kills, and my heart aches for every one of them.  For miserable, dissatisfied, disappointed, 
		 unhappy creatures the dizzy old earth can show them no equal."</p></blockquote>
		 
		 <p> The sketch cites Stephen Crane and Della Fox as cautionary examples.  Following this is an exchange of three brief 
		 letters between Sears and L.B.R. about the piece, some of which are written as limericks.</p>
