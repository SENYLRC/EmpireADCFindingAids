      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Douglas MacGregor, professionally known as Doug MacGregor, is an American cartoonist. He received his BFA from Syracuse University in 1979.</p>
      <p>Doug MacGregor grew up in Binghamton, New York and began his cartooning career drawing sports cartoons for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Daily Orange</emph> newspaper while a student at Syracuse University. He also served as the art director for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Report</emph> newspaper and his illustrations appeared on Syracuse Orange basketball programs. After receiving a BFA in Illustration in 1979, he landed a post as an editorial cartoonist for the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Norwich (Conn.) Bulletin</emph> in 1980 where he drew five cartoons a week. Influenced  by Cincinnati Enquirer cartoonist, Jim Borgman, MacGregor also credits one of his social studies teachers with getting him interested in current events.   </p>
      <p>His work received national exposure early-on, appearing occasionally on the opinion page of 
        
        <emph render="italic">USA Today</emph> and one of his cartoons depicting Ronald Reagan was selected for the cover of the 1982 edition of the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year</emph>. MacGregor's tenure with the Fort Myers (Fla.) 
        
        <emph render="italic">News-Press</emph> began in 1988. In 1997 he began drawing a local comic strip titled 
        
        <emph render="italic">Sunny Side Up</emph> which explores life in southwest Florida. MacGregor's cartoons appear through syndication in several other Florida newspapers. </p>
      <p>MacGregor is a member of both the American Association of Editorial Cartoonists and the National Cartoonists Society.  He has received numerous state and national awards, including multiple Best of Gannett awards. Several published collections of MacGregor's cartoons have appeared including, 
        
        <emph render="italic">A Collection of MacGregor Editorial cartoons from the Norwich bulletin</emph> (1988) and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Doug MacGregor's Cartoons: A Twenty-five Year Retrospective</emph>, released in 2005.</p>
      <p>Doug MacGregor also draws freelance cartoons, illustrates children's books and self-syndicates his work.</p>
    </bioghist>
    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Doug MacGregor Papers</emph> are divided into 4 series. The first series, 
        
        <emph render="bold">Editorial cartoons</emph> offers examples of MacGregor's work as an editorial cartoonist from 1980 to 2004. The cartoons were published in 
        
        the <emph render="italic">Norwich (Conn.) Bulletin</emph> and the Fort Myers (Fla.) 
        
        <emph render="italic">News-Press</emph>.  Major subjects include              U.S. presidents (particularly Bill Clinton), elections, sports, the O.J. Simpson trial, education and foreign relations.    </p>
      <p>The majority of the cartoons are originals, although several laser prints are included. Most of the  cartoons are labeled on the back with stickers listing a letter and a number, reflecting MacGregor's organizational scheme. Items labeled with the "I" prefix include 5 unfinished drawings,  including 4 done in color. Several cartoons have stickers on the back with more details about the particular event depicted.  Sizes vary, but most are approximately 11 ½" x 14 ½" and many are matted.  The majority of the cartoons were drawn with pen and ink and there are several cartoons done in color. See the detailed inventory for more information on the medium.  </p>
      <p>The second series, 
        
        <emph render="bold">Syracuse University cartoons and illustrations</emph> contains examples of MacGregor's student work at Syracuse University (1976-1979). Included are 16 original sports cartoons (with one self portrait) drawn for the student newspaper, the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Daily Orange</emph> and three pieces of color, original artwork used on the cover of Syracuse Orange basketball programs (copies of the programs are included).   It is worth nothing that MacGregor's sports cartoons appeared during a time of controversy over the university's Saltine Warrior mascot. Many of MacGregor's cartoons depict the traditional American Indian mascot as well as a newer version of the mascot appearing as a Roman warrior.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Publications</emph> contains five complete issues of the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Daily Orange</emph> (1952, 1977) with cartoons by MacGregor, four issues of the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Report</emph> newspaper (1978) for which MacGregor was art director and issues of other Syracuse University publications including 
        
        <emph render="italic">Syracuse Poems</emph> (one issue contains artwork by MacGregor), 
        
        <emph render="italic">Syracuse Review</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Orange Crush</emph>.  There are also several published collections of MacGregor's work.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Clippings</emph> contains several clippings of MacGregor's sports cartoons from the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Daily Orange</emph> and an article from the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Syracuse Herald Journal</emph> about changes to the Syracuse University mascot.</p>
