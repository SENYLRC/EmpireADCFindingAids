         <head>Biographical History</head>
<p>Jonathan Pratt came to Gorham Township in New York State between 1800 and 1810. The Federal 
Census of 1810 showed six members in his household at that time; by 1820 this 
had increased to ten. One brother, Elisha Pratt, lived nearby and was one of 
the first hunters and teachers in that area; another brother, James, was a 
doctor in Madison County, New York.</p>

<p>Jonathan Pratt, Jr. suffered ill health in his early years.  He became a doctor 
after studying with relatives in Madison County and in Pawlet, 
Vermont.  Dr. Pratt's first wife was Julia Ann Smith, daughter of 
Andrew and Rebecca Smith, with whom he had two children, Andrew and Eugene.  
After Julia's death the two children were 
raised by an elderly aunt and uncle.  Dr. Pratt's second wife was Minerva 
Webb; the census of 1850 listed their two children as Charles Carlton and 
Cornelia. Only Carlton outlived his father and mother.</p>

<p>Dr. Jonathan Pratt tried several lines of work, including merchant and postmaster, 
with little success; his time as a postmaster was marked with 
political unrest. However, he did well as a physician and as a farmer.</p>

<p>Andrew Smith Pratt attended Lima Seminary and traveled as a lecturer on the 
Lyceum circuit. His brother Eugene worked for a gunpowder company in Xenia, 
Ohio and traveled extensively.</p>

<p>Dr. Jonathan Pratt's brother Amos moved out west; his two sisters Mary and 
Julia never married.</p>

<p>An abbreviated <extref href="pratt_fam.bmp">Pratt family tree</extref> appears 
at the end of this finding aid.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Biographical material</emph> consists of notes, photocopies, and other material about the Pratt family.  This material was gathered by University staff while processing the collection.</p><p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> (1821-1863) spans three generations of the Pratt family. The 
letters of Jonathan Pratt, the elder, mention prominent persons and early 
settlers of the Phelps and Gorham purchase.</p>

<p>The letters from Amos Pratt tell about the relentless urge to move westward, 
and outline his various attempts at business from harness making to running a 
tavern. His nephew Eugene Pratt often wrote to urge his brother Andrew Pratt 
to join him on the road selling gunpowder.</p>

<p>In 1841 Jonathan Pratt, Jr. ran for postmaster of Rushville. There are 
numerous copies of letters drafted but never sent to Francis Granger, the 
postmaster General. When Harrison died after one month as President many 
political appointments were reassigned to members of John Tyler's party. 
Jonathan's letters are drafted to both the old and new postmaster generals.</p><p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> consists of a photocopy of Jonathan Pratt, Jr.'s journal of an 1833 trip to Florida.  The original resides in the Canandaigua Historical Society.  A personal note written at the bottom by a cousin, Candice 
Birdseye Hobart, gives information about Pratt's second wife and surviving son Carlton, and 
mentions that few family records are left because the family 
home burned to the ground</p>

<p>The <emph render="bold">Andrew Smith Pratt papers</emph> consist of clippings, 
drafts of school compositions, copies of Lyceum speeches (for example, concerning 
William Morgan and in defense of the Anti-Masonic Party), and a few legal documents concerning Andrew's estate.</p>
