         <p>The Taylor family represented in this collection is primarily the immediate family of
            Albert B. Taylor, Superintendent of Telegraph of the New York Central &amp; Hudson River
            Railroad between 1906 and 1928. His father, Jeremiah B. Taylor, was a Baptist minister
            who left New York City for Kansas in the 1860s. The whole family moved to Kansas, but
            Albert and his brother Joseph were taken back to New York in the 1870s and raised by an
            uncle, Isaac Remsen Blauvelt. Eventually the entire family returned to New York and
            lived in Brooklyn.</p>
         <p>Albert B. Taylor married Mary S. Deane, the daughter of Robert and Jane Deane. Robert
            Deane was a distinguished engineer for the British Navy in India, where he worked
            building bridges in difficult locations using his exceptional skill with the diving
            bell. His first wife, Sylvia S. Shields, and their infant son were murdered in the
            Indian Rebellion of 1857 by their native servants. Jane S. Willis had travelled to India
            in 1856 with her mother and fiancé, Robert Horn, to live with relatives. They, too, were
            caught up in the Indian Rebellion and lived with hundreds of other British subjects
            under siege in the Fort of Agra. Robert Horn and Jane's mother both died during the
            siege. Jane S. Willis met Robert Deane and they were married in 1860. They had four
            children (Mary, William, Florence, and Blanche) in India before moving to the United
            States in 1867. </p>
         <p>Albert began studying to become a teacher but abandoned that field in favor of learning
            to be a stenographer. He became the secretary for the Manager of the New York, West
            Shore and Buffalo Railroad. Albert and Mary Taylor had eight children: Albert W.
            ("Bert"), Joseph H. ("Joe"), Mary F. ("Maidie" or "Florence"), Elizabeth C. ("Bess"),
            Blanche S., Elsie D. ("Deane"), Edna B., and Violet J. ("Budge"). </p>
         <p>Bert died young in 1911. Joe became a civil engineer, worked for Lockheed and moved to
            California, raising his children Nancy and Don there. Florence married a man named
            Walter Penshaw. Bess became assistant to the head of the New York Railroad company.
            Blanche married a teacher named Robert Rodgers, born in Scotland and a veteran of World
            War I, and they had two sons, Robert (known as Robin or Robbie) and Eric. Robin died in
            1945 in an airplane crash while training in Georgia for the US Army Air Corps during
            World War II. Eric eventually married a woman with two children named Laurie and Jimmy
            Mansfield. Deane married a man named Finn Finne, taught, and is responsible for most of
            the genealogical research of the family. Edna married a Dr. Richard Feige and lived in
            Maplewood, New Jersey. Budge married a man named Peter Schroeder and both became
            professors at the University of Connecticut. All of the Taylor daughters were college
            graduates. Blanche was the only daughter to have children and Joe's children are the
            only grandchildren of Albert B. Taylor's to have children of their own.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Taylor Family Collection</emph> consists of correspondence,
            genealogical material, legal documents, and memorabilia.</p>
         <p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> is the bulk of the collection. The letters are
            separated by author. The most heavily represented writer of the collection is Mary Deane
            Taylor, Albert B. Taylor's wife, who often lived apart from her husband while he was
            working for the railroad in a secretarial capacity. Those letters are primarily between
            1882 and 1889, though there are more letters written by Mary to her grown daughters
            spanning the decades before her death in 1919. Correspondence also includes a collection
            of early to mid- 20th century greeting cards collected primarily by Robert M. Rodgers
            and his wife, Blanche Taylor Rodgers. </p>
         <p><emph render="bold">Genealogical material</emph> includes genealogical records and
            family history. There are family tree diagrams as well as narratives about the 18th and
            19th century ancestors. </p>
         <p><emph render="bold">Legal documents</emph> are divided into four family sections,
            representing the Blauvelt, Deane, Rodgers, and Taylor families. The folders include
            deeds, stock certificates, marriage certificates, wills, legal correspondence about
            wills, and contracts.</p>
         <p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> is comprised of clippings, programs from events,
            photographs, and objects collected by family members as keepsakes, such as a woodblock
            and a watch. There is also a folder of religious material, including a bible belonging
            to Albert B. Taylor and prayer books from the 1860s. About half of the photographs in
            the collection are unlabeled and have been separated from those in which the subject has
            been identified.</p>
