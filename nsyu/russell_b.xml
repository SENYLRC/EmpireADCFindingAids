      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Bruce Alexander Russell (1903-1963) was a Pulitzer Prize winning American cartoonist who spent over 30 years at the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph>. </p>
      <p>Russell  was born in Los Angeles on August 4, 1903, the son of Alexander and Flora (Saunders) Russell. In 1921 Russell graduated from Los Angeles Polytechnic High School and in 1926 he received a degree from the University of California at Los Angeles, where he had drawn cartoons for the university newspaper, 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">The Daily Bruin</emph>, and for 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">The California Grizzly</emph>. Russell began his professional career at the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Los Angeles 
        
        Evening Herald</emph>. His early work appeared in various national publications, among them 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">College Humor</emph> and 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Collier's</emph>, as well as in 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">The California Pelican</emph>, published in Berkeley. In 1927  Russell joined the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph> art staff as a sports and theater cartoonist and also sketched for the paper's illustrated magazine. During
this period he created the popular Associated Press comic strip 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Rollo Rollingstone</emph>, which ran from 1930 to 1933. In 1934 Russell became the editorial cartoonist for the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph>, a position he retained until his death nearly thirty years later when he was replaced by Paul Conrad.  </p>
      <p>Russell won a Pulitzer Prize in 1946 for his cartoon "Time to Bridge That Gulch" that was published on November 30, 1945 and depicted the gap between the United States and Russia. Sigma Delta Chi presented him with the  Distinguished Service Award in 1948, 1950 and 1951.  He also received the Headliners' Award for editorial cartoons in 1949, and from 1949 to 1962 his work was annually recognized by the Freedoms Foundation award. His other honors include the Christopher Award (1953) and an award from the U.S. Treasury (1960 or 1958?). At UCLA, Russell was named the Edward A. Dickson Alumnus of the year in 1951. Russell was a member of the National Cartoonists Society and the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists. </p>
      <p>On December 18, 1963 Bruce Russell died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The  
        
        <emph render="bold">Bruce Russell Papers</emph> contain original artwork, correspondence, memorabilia, the artist's idea file, clippings and writings. The collection documents the Russell's career as a cartoonist and his work in several genres with material from the early 1920s through his death in 1963. It also includes original works by other cartoonists, often inscribed to Russell.  </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Cartoon clippings</emph> provides examples of Russell's published work. Items are arranged within categories that reflect the development of Russell's career: college and other early work, comic strips and features, editorial cartoons (mostly from the <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph>), Hollywood and theater, <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph> work (excluding editorial cartoons), and sports cartoons. Samples of his early work include clippings from       
        
        
        <emph render="italic">The California Pelican</emph>, 
                
        
        <emph render="italic">Southern Alumnus</emph>, and 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">College Humor</emph>. His comic features include <emph render="italic">The Week in Review</emph> and <emph render="italic">Cartoonews</emph>, as well as the strips 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Good Old Chump</emph> and 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Rollo Rollingstone</emph>.
</p>
      <p>Editorial cartoons prepared daily for the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph> between 1928 and 1963 form the largest part of the clippings section. Clippings of editorial cartoons from 1946 to 1963 are mostly cut from the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Times</emph> editorial page and are substantially complete, arranged chronologically to the day. There is a gap between mid-July 1952 and December 1953. </p>
      <p>As seen in both the clippings and  the original drawings (see below), Russell's editorial work paralleled the generally conservative editorial viewpoint of the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph>. Recorded by Russell's pen were two major wars and the harbingers of the war in Vietnam, the beginnings of space exploration, the emergence of new political leaders, among them the Californian Richard Nixon, and life in southern California as the area grew in economic and political influence. Besides the national and international events that provided topics for his editorial comment, there also recur in his cartoon work references to rising taxes and Los Angeles politics, as well as many public service themes: traffic safety, the scouting movement, U.S. savings bonds, and charitable fund drives. During these years he developed a number of stylistic devices: the shrouded skeleton, an oafish Mars, the impoverished taxpayer dressed in a barrel, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, punning cartoon titles, 
the personifications John Q. Public and Miss Democracy, map outlines of political boundaries used metaphorically, and, from World War II, a maniacal Hitler, a slovenly Mussolini, and a fierce stereotype of the Japanese.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> contains a small amount of both incoming and outgoing correspondence. Correspondents of interest include Richard Nixon, Eleanor Roosevelt, and staff at  MGM and Collier's.  Subjects include acceptance notices for submitted artwork, requests for original cartoons and notes thanking the artist for his cooperation
in charitable drives. </p>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Idea file</emph> series contains folders of illustrations, mostly clippings, as well as sketches, photographs, and published cartoons, that constitute a working reference file used by Russell in his work. The subject headings as they appear on the folders are Russell's own, except for headings in brackets. There are folders for political figures and other notables, Russell trademarks such as Tweedledum and Tweedledee and his characterization of the Roman god Mars, and traditional symbols as the donkey and the elephant, bulls and bears, the eagle, Father Time, and Uncle Sam. There is also a folder of clippings of work by other cartoonists.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> contains a variety of material, primarily related to Russell's career.    Included here are his diploma from cartooning school before he entered the University of California, awards, photographs  of Russell and his family, and autographed photographs of notables including California political figures Edmund ("Pat") Brown, Goodwin Knight, Norris Poulson, James Roosevelt, labor leader John L. Lewis, Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., Arthur E. Summerfield, Raymond Moley, Senator Harry L. Byrd, and the cartoonists Rube Goldberg and George McManus. Also included here is promotional material, clippings of articles about Russell, exhibition information, a copyright registration card and miscellaneous proofs. 
</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Original drawings</emph>, which spans more then seventy years, is subdivided into drawings by Russell and drawings by others. Original artwork by Bruce Russell spans his professional career, from early sketches in the 1920s  to some of his last editorial cartoons. Some pieces of his non-editorial work are signed with the name "Bruce Barr."  Most of this work was done for the 
        
        
        
        <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Times</emph>.  There are over 650 finished drawings by Russell, including more than 240 editorial cartoons and over 300 drawings for the comic strip 
        
        <emph render="italic">Rollo Rollingstone</emph>. There are also 50 pencil sketches for editorial cartoons. Also worth noting are Russell's Hollywood and theatre illustrations.     A <ref target="tic">topical index to Russell's original editorial cartoon art</ref> may be found at the end of this inventory.</p>
      <p>Original drawings by other artists contains more than 160 pieces of art by fellow cartoonists and artists. Many are inscribed to Russell. Among the editorial cartoonists represented are Gib Crockett, Herblock, Jim Ivey, Bill Mauldin, Carey Orr and Vaughn Shoemaker. Work by the cartoonists Al Capp, Rube Goldberg, Jimmy Hatlo, and George Herriman is also present, along with a color cell from a Woody Woodpecker animation and a Charles Schulz "Peanuts" strip from 1955. There are also several cartoons by unidentified artists. </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Writings</emph> consists of notes about the comic strip 
        
        <emph render="italic">Rollo Rollingstone</emph> and typed questions prepared for Russell's appearance before a State Department and Pentagon panel in 1963. </p>

    <arrangement encodinganalog="351$a">
      <head>Arrangement of the Collection</head>
      <p>Cartoon clippings are subdivided by type and within that arranged in roughly chronological order.  Correspondence is arranged in chronological order. Idea files are alphabetical by subject.  Original drawings are subdivided into those by Russell and those by other artists; within that, Russell's are further subdivided by type and then arranged alphabetically by caption, while those by other artists are arranged alphabetically by artist's last name.</p>
