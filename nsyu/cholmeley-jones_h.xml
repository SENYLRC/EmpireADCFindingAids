      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Henrietta Howard Boit Sturgis Cholmeley-Jones (1896-1985) was an American author and artist.  Born October 29, 1896 in Murray Hill, Manhattan, to Tate Robert Sturgis (of Boston and Philadelphia and New 
York), and Marion Sharpless (of "Laburnums", Chelton Hills, 
Philadelphia), she 
graduated from The Chapin School in 1914 and went on to study art with Frederick 
Theodore Weber.   In June 1920, she married E.O. (Edward Owen) Nigel Cholmeley-Jones, former lieutenant in the American Expeditionary Forces and advertising 
representative for 
        
        <emph render="italic">Current Literature</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">McClure's Magazine</emph>, Paul Block and Associates, and the 
        
        <emph render="italic">National Geographic</emph>.  For most of her life she and her husband lived in Westport and Norwalk, Connecticut.</p>
      <p>For five years Cholmeley-Jones was a supervisor of the WPA Westport Art Project.   She was active in both World Wars, as chairman of civilian 
groups (in Philadelphia, New York and Westport), and she was a member of the 
Temple of Religion committee of the World's Fair in New York.
 She was a member of 
the National Society of Colonial Dames, DAR, Society of Mayflower Descendants, 
Society of Daughters of Holland Dames, Huguenot Society, New York Women Poets, 
Pen and Brush, American Poetry League, Alumnae Association of Chapin School 
Ltd., and a former member of the New York Junior League. She was an Honorary 
Trustee of the Kips Bay Boys Club Inc. of New York City, having been one of its 
founders in 1915. Among her many community activities, both in New York prior to 
1931 and in Connecticut thereafter, she was a chairman for Weekday Religious 
Education in the Greater New York Federation of Churches and spoke on religion 
on the New York City radio stations of 1929-1931.</p>
      <p>A prize-winning poet, her poems have been published in 
nearly fifty American publications including over twenty books; she was also an essayist/ commentator on current 
events. With her two sons Edward and Richard 
Cholmeley-Jones, she authored 
        
        <emph render="italic">Slow Advance (1914-1944)</emph>, a book of war poems.   Her pictures, 
done in nine media including drypoint etching, have been exhibited over ninety 
times - in both New York and Connecticut - including a one-woman show in 1959 in 
Westport, Connecticut.  She was also interested in automatic writing and produced numerous examples during her life.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Henrietta Cholmeley-Jones Papers</emph> consist of her autobiography, biographical material, incoming and outgoing correspondence, legal material, subject files, works (literary and artistic),

published material, memorabilia, automatic writings, and printed materials.</p>
      <p>The collection begins with 
        
        <emph render="bold">Autobiographical</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="bold">Biographical materials</emph> begin the collection. The former consists of a copy of "In Anecdotage," her autobiography; the latter includes Cholmeley-Jones' listings in several national and international biographic dictionaries.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> is divided into incoming (1894-1970) and outgoing sections. Incoming includes a small amount of family material as well 
as exchanges with, among others, Cornelia Skinner, Governor John Lodge and 
Dorothy Bird.  If an exchange arrived securely fastened, both incoming and outgoing 
correspondence have been placed, together, in Incoming. Outgoing correspondence 
(1946-1964) consists only of those letters belonging to no existing 
exchange in Incoming.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Legal material</emph> consists solely of a certification of executrices, 1934, for the 
Marion Sturgis Estate.</p>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Subject file</emph> consists of printed material and correspondence related to Cholmeley-Jones' projects and organizations. An especially strong file is that referring 
to the WPA Art project for Westport, Connecticut. Correspondence, 1936-1938, 
financial records, news clippings, notes, photographs, printed material and 
reports demonstrate the extent to which this town was involved with the project.
The Works section is subdivided into </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Works</emph> comprises General Writings, Diaries, Drawings, Music 
Scores, Poems and Radio Speeches.  General writings are arranged alphabetically by title and range in date from 
1919 to 1976. The 1919 item is a dramatization of Henry Van Dyke's "First 
Christmas Tree" with music and stage directions by H.H.B. Sturgis.
Many of the writings are undated.  Diaries date from 1913 to 1965-6 but are for scattered years, no runs exist in 
this collection.  Loose drawings are either undated or represent the years 1914-16.
The 8 music scores are arranged in alphabetical order. Again most are undated 
save for "Reverie", 1932 and "Victory Song", 1942.
Poems are also arranged in alphabetical order by title. Those which have been 
combined under a collective title precede the general alphabetical arrangement. 
Thus: 
        
        <emph render="italic">Intimate Circuit</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">More Than Pattern</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Sequence of Seven Sonnets to my 
Mother</emph> (1931-7) and 
        
        <emph render="italic">World War, 1914-1944</emph> precede the single poems which are not 
listed individually.
The last section of works, Radio Speeches, is arranged by date in one folder.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Published materials</emph> will be found separately by type
and authorship. Articles, poems and newsclips are each divided by Cholmeley-Jones as 
author or subject. Included also in this section is a copy of 
        
        <emph render="italic">Slow Advance, 
1914-1944</emph>, war poems by H. Sturgis, Edward Sturgis and Richard Gilder Cholmeley-Jones.</p>
      <p>With the 
        
        <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> it is possible to scan Cholmeley-Jones' heritage and interests.  A general family scrapbook is followed by Henrietta Howard Boit Sturgis' 
baby book, memory books, awards, photographs and a 50th wedding anniversary 
book, prepared for Henrietta and Nigel Cholmeley-Jones. Also included here are 
vols. 1, 3 and 4 of the Theatre books, one on William Gillette, the other 
containing sketches and writings produced under the name "Rita Sturgis."
Finally, there are the drypoint etching plates made for Christmas or greeting 
cards, and a magazine of 36 slides, part recording Cholmeley-Jones' art exhibition, 
October 1959, the rest showing the interior of her cherished home, Underdene 
(Connecticut).</p>
      <p>Boxes 13 and 14 contain 
        
        <emph render="bold">Automatic Writings</emph>. Writings which were specifically 
labeled as to communicator have been placed in an alphabetical sequence 
following a general chronological run.  Titled 
        
        <emph render="bold">Works</emph> produced by automatic writings are next, including 
        
        <emph render="italic">Bow to the Duke</emph> 
and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Paris Secret</emph>.</p>
      <p>Lastly are the 
        
        <emph render="bold">Published volumes</emph> containing Cholmeley-Jones' works or her 
additions, as letters, poems, photographs, drawings or clippings.</p>
