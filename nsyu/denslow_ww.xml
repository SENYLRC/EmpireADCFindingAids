			<head>Biographical History</head>
			
		<p>William Wallace Denslow (1856-1915) was an American artist and illustrator, best known as the illustrator of 	L. Frank Baum's <emph render="italic">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</emph>. While much of his additional work as an artist and illustrator wasn't recognized until the late twentieth century, he eventually garnered praise for his clever and often cynical designs, his striking, multicolored posters, his ability to target his illustrations by audience, and for amending popular children's verse to avoid what he considered unnecessary violence and questionable content.</p><p>Denslow began training in design and illustration at age 14 at the Cooper Union Institute and the National Academy of Art and Design, both in New York City. He began selling his work at age twenty, worked for newspapers and periodicals, designed theatrical costumes and posters in Chicago, and created advertising and literature for Roycroft, a handicraft studio. </p><p>In 1896, Denslow met Baum, and the two collaborated on <emph render="italic">Father Goose, His Book</emph>. A year later, they published <emph render="italic">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</emph>, which soon became an American icon and children's literary breakthrough. They only collaborated on one more book, <emph render="italic">Dot and Tot of Merryland</emph>, considered Denslow's most purely decorative creation. Some people attribute the bitter separation of the men to Denslow's greed, especially when financial disputes arose after <emph render="italic">The Wonderful World of Oz</emph> was transformed into a popular film. </p><p>Denslow spent the latter part of his career illustrating, rewriting, and reinterpreting classic children's stories and fairy tales, often removing what he considered to be violent and immoral behavior from the works. During this time, he suffered from a drinking problem and never reclaimed the intensity of his early success. He died in 1915.</p><p>(Adapted from "W(illiam) W(allace) Denslow" in <emph render="italic">Contemporary Authors</emph>.)</p></bioghist>
