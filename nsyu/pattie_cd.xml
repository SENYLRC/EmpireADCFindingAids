      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Based on information in the collection, C. D. Pattie  is probably Charles Dummer Pattie (or Pattee) of Saginaw County, Michigan (d. 1906).   The writer was stationed at Benton Barracks in St. Louis, a Union camp, and all of the stationery is Union-oriented in its design, so he was presumably a Union soldier.  He appears to have been a cavalry man due to the frequent mentions of horses and tack.  He mentions Michigan frequently, and in his January 1st 1862 letter references a man in his regiment named George Gleeflegle who had died a few days earlier.   George Gleeflegle (there are unlikely to have been more than one person with such a unique name) was in the 3rd Michigan Cavalry, Co. M and died on December 30, 1862, which corresponds with the facts given in the letter, and the 3rd Michigan Cavalry was indeed stationed at Benton Barracks from Nov, 28, 1861 to Feb. 21, 1862.  A listing of the men in Co M. includes one Charles D. Pattee of Saginaw County, MI.    Pattee enlisted on September 16, 1861 and was discharged in St. Louis for disability on April 19, 1864.  He died in 1906 when he was struck by a street car.</p><p>[&scrc_name; gratefully acknowledges the assistance of researcher Nanci Gasiel in providing this biographical information.]</p>
