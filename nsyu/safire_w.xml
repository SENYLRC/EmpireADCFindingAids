      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>William Lewis Safire (1929-2009) was an American author, columnist, lexicographer, novelist,
        public relations executive, reporter, and White House speechwriter. Safire was born on
        December 17, 1929, in New York, NY, to thread merchant Oliver C. and his wife Ida Panish
        Safir. (He later added the "e" to his name to help with pronunciation). He graduated from
        the Bronx High School of Science, a specialized high school known for its focus on
        mathematics and science, and enrolled at Syracuse University in 1947. Safire dropped out in
        1949 after his sophomore year and his older brother Leonard, a copy boy for columnist and
        public relations man Tex McCrary, encouraged his younger brother to apply for a job at the
          
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Herald Tribune</emph>. He was hired as a researcher and
        writer for the paper's "Close-Up" column which gave him the opportunity to interview
        celebrities such as Mae West. </p>
      <p>He continued working in public relations as a
correspondence in Europe and the Middle East for radio station WNBC and
WNBT-TV as well as for the Army in 1952-1954. He returned to work with
McCrary on the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Tex and Jinx radio</emph> and television shows and
later as vice-president of Tex McCrary, Inc., a public relations firm where
he arranged the "kitchen debate" in Moscow between Richard Nixon and Nikita
Khrushchev in 1959. </p>
      <p>In 1961, he established his own firm, Safire Public
Relations, where his clients included an ice cream manufacturer, a laxative
company, and various political campaigns. He sold his company in 1968 for
$335,000 and joined the White House staff where he served as an advisor,
special assistant, speechwriter, and media consultant to Richard Nixon.</p>
      <p>He left his post at the White House in 1973 to join the staff at the 
        
        <emph render="italic">New
York Times</emph>. He was hired on the spot by publisher Arthur
"Punch" Sulzberger, Sr. as the paper's new political columnist. Safire's
twice-weekly "Essay" column appeared on the Op-Ed page for thirty-two years
and presented a libertarian conservative point of view. He earned the
Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary in 1978 for his column on the
alleged budgetary infractions of Bert Lance. He later served on the Pulitzer
Prize board from 1995-2004.</p>
      <p>His Sunday column, "On Language" (1979-2009)
    appeared in the 
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Times Magazine</emph> and featured commentary
on grammar, usage and etymology. The column attracted many fans and devoted
correspondents, dubbed the Lexicographic Irregulars.</p>
      <p>In 2000, he was hired
as chairman and chief executive officer of the Charles A. Dana Foundation, a
philanthropic organization supporting brain science, immunology, and arts
education. He also served on the Syracuse University Board of Trustees. In
2006, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W.
Bush. </p>
      <p>He authored many books including 
        
        <emph render="italic">Safire's New Political
Dictionary</emph>, a study of the words that have inspired and
    inflamed the electorate; 
        
        <emph render="italic">Freedom</emph>, about the Civil War; and
    
        
        <emph render="italic">Scandalmonger</emph>, about the origins of America's press
    freedom. His anthology of the world's greatest speeches, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Lend Me Your
Ears</emph>, has become a classic. He frequently contributed to
    periodicals and newspapers including 
        
        <emph render="italic">Cosmopolitan</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">New
      York Times Book Review</emph>, and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Playboy</emph>. </p>
      <p>Safire
married Helene Belmar Julius in 1962. The couple had two children, Mark
Lindsey and Annabel Victoria. </p>
      <p>William Safire died on September 27, 2009 in
Rockville, Maryland. </p>

            <note>
              <p>Authors often sent copies of their books to Safire with notes, and Safire kept the notes with the books.
    The books were transferred to general collections for cataloging, and the notes were removed from the books and placed here. 
    Notes from authors include correspondence from Arianna Huffington, Ben Stein, and Eric Foner, amongst many others.   
    Please note that the correspondence is arranged alphabetically by title of the book that the item originally accompanied.</p>

          <p>Note that material relating to a given person, place, organization or subject may appear in several places in this series.  For example, material relating to George W. Bush appears under "Bush, George W." as a main subject, but also as a sub-topic under "Privacy."  Likewise, material relating to Iran appears under "Iran" as a main subject, but also as a sub-topic under the subjects "Bosnia" and "Israel."  Where possible, cross-references are provided in the  finding aid to direct the reader to related material, but these cross-references should not be taken as comprehensive; the diligent researcher will search thoroughly for all occurences (and alternate spellings/abbreviations) of a topic.</p>
