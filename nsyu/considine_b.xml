      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Bob Considine (1906-1975) was an American journalist and author, best known as the author of 

        
        <emph render="italic">Thirty Seconds over Tokyo</emph> and 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Babe Ruth Story</emph>, and for his 
long-running syndicated daily column "On the Line," which ran for thirty years in newspapers across the United States.</p>
      <p>Bob Considine was born in Washington, DC on November 4, 1906. He attended Gonzaga High School in the city, and 
afterward majored in journalism at George Washington University, taking evening classes while working a variety of 
government jobs during the day. As a clerk at the Department of State, he met Mildred (Millie) Anderson, his future wife. 
His tennis interest (Considine was a noted tennis player in his early years, winning the 1929 National Public Parks 
doubles championship, the 1930 District of Columbia singles championship, and later about fifty other state and regional 
titles) led to his first job as a journalist, when he began to write a weekly tennis column at the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Washington Post</emph> in 
1929. A year later he was offered a full-time job in the sports department at the paper, writing sports, drama, 
and Sunday feature articles. In 1933 he moved over to the 
        
        <emph render="italic">Washington Herald</emph>, a Hearst paper, where he served as sports 
editor and editorial and feature writer, and started his column "On the Line," at this time only on sports.</p>
      <p>William Randolph Hearst brought Considine to New York City in 1937 to work with the 
        
        <emph render="italic">New York American</emph>, then transferred 
him to the 
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Daily Mirror</emph> (another Hearst paper), and subsequently to the Hearst syndicate, the International News 
Service (INS), which began syndication of his famous near-daily column "On the Line."  He served as war correspondent in 
both the European and Pacific theaters during World War II, also covered the Korean War in the same position. At that time, he 
became a syndicated columnist and was also heard nightly on the radio in a program of news analysis and opinion, "On the Line." 
As a correspondent and reporter, Considine covered many of the famous people of the era he was writing in, particularly 
from the 1940s to the early 1960s and especially political leaders like Eisenhower and Nixon, American military leaders, 
and Roman Catholic Popes. In his "On the Line" columns, he traded anecdotes from his many trips around the world and 
from New York City, where he lived. He was known for being a quick typist, and this contributed to his prolificacy and 
workaholic nature. Two historical trips stand out: the interview with Nikita Krushchev at the height of the Cold 
War in 1957 in Moscow by the Hearst Papers team (of which Considine was a part), and Richard Nixon's 1972 trip to China (Considine was part of the press corps that accompanied the President).</p>
      <p>Considine was also active as an author, especially as a collaborator with famous persons writing their autobiographies. 
His books include 
        
        <emph render="italic">Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo</emph> (with Capt. Ted Lawson); 
        
        <emph render="italic">Gen. Wainwright's Story</emph> (with Gen. Jonathan 
Wainwright); 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Babe Ruth Story</emph> (with Babe Ruth); 
        
        <emph render="italic">Men Against Fire</emph>, 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Men Who Robbed Brink's</emph>. and 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Remarkable Life of 
Dr. Armand Hammer</emph>. He also wrote for the movies, including 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Babe Ruth Story</emph> for Allied Artists and 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Beginning or the 
End</emph> (about the development of the first atomic bomb) for MGM.</p>
      <p>Considine won numerous awards for his newspaper work including the Lasker Award and the Overseas Press Club Award, and was 
twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. He served as president of the Overseas Press Club and was a member of the National 
Press Club.  Considine traveled the world as a reporter but New York City remained his home and he died 
there in 1975, an active writer to the very end -- his last "On the Line" column was published in September, only a few days before his death.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Bob Considine Papers</emph> consists of biographical material, correspondence, subject files, manuscripts, memorabilia, 
newspaper columns, published material, and recordings (both audio and visual).</p>
      <p>A single folder of 
        
        <emph render="bold">Biographical material</emph> is filed at the beginning of the collection.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> is divided into four parts: General correspondence, Fan mail, Outgoing 
correspondence, and Correspondence of others. General correspondence consists of letters from friends, fellow journalists 
and authors (Walter Annenberg, "Bugs" Baer, Richard Berlin, William Randolph Hearst, Anita Loos), celebrities (Maurice 
Chevalier, Clark Gable, Zsa Zsa Gabor), political and military figures (Spiro Agnew, Omar Bradley, Dwight Eisenhower, 
J. Edgar Hoover, Douglas MacArthur, Richard Nixon), businessmen (Bernard Baruch, Armand Hammer), religious 
leaders (Cardinal Francis Spellman), and various groups and organizations. Fan mail is from readers of his column.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Subject files</emph>, most of which were compiled by Considine and remain as he created them, 
cover a variety of topics.  Most appear to be background material for potential or 
completed projects on individuals (Jack Dempsey, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower) or subjects such as the 
Beverly Wilshire Hotel, wonder drugs, and  	various types of aircraft including the F-80 and the Boeing 747.  There 
are also bills and invoices, information on a Bob Considine Scholarship Fund, material relating to organizations with which Considine 
was involved, letters to the editor, memos, information on Pope Paul VI's visit to Israel, photographs of Considine 
(alone and with others), reviews of Considine's books, telephone messages, and so on.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Manuscripts</emph> includes both those by Considine and those by others. Manuscripts by Considine 
(1927-1975) contains a wide range of formats, including articles, books, broadcasts, interviews, movie scripts, reports, 
screenplays, speeches, stories, and television shows.  Manuscripts by others (1926-1974) is likewise varied, including 
articles, books, interviews, outlines, poems, scripts, speeches, and stories.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> consists mostly of scrapbooks.  Of particular interest is the one on Considine's 
1957 trip to the Soviet Union with William Randolph Hearst, Jr. and their meeting with Nikita Krushchev.  A small amount of miscellaneous 
memorabilia completes this section.</p>
      <p>The separate 
        
        <emph render="bold">Newspaper column, "On the Line"</emph> series consists of typescripts 
of Considine's daily "On the Line" column, which was syndicated in hundreds of INS newspapers from coast to coast.  Considine 
covered whatever was happening at the time, from national events (the Vietnam War, Watergate, the US space 
program) to political happenings (Nixon's trip to China, the Democratic and Republican conventions) to the 
New York City scene (the closing of Toots Shor's iconic restaurant).  Occasionally his columns touched on personal thoughts, such 
as his "Newspaperman's Prayer," or his column on the occasion of his granddaughter starting kindergarten (where she would, she announced, "learn to protect her own cat.")</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Published material</emph> contains a wide range of printed or published items, most of which are 
by, about, or featuring Considine.  These include advertisements, articles, books, catalogs, newspaper clippings, magazines, 
newsletters, promotional material, and much more.  A number of published editions of books by Considine have been 
transferred to Rare Books for cataloging; they are noted in the inventory below.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Recordings</emph> consists of more than 25 audio recordings in various formats, and two films.  
The audio recordings include news broadcasts (Chet Huntley and David Brinkley), speeches and addresses (Lt. Gen. Maxwell 
Taylor), notable events ("One Giant Step" featuring Neil Armstrong), and several commercial recordings of popular 
music (e.g., Elvis Presley).</p>
