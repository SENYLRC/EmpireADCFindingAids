      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Street &amp; Smith, or Street and Smith Publications, Inc., was a New York City publisher specializing in inexpensive 
paperbacks, magazines, and comic books.  Founded in 1855 by Francis Scott Street and Francis Shubael Smith, most of their 
publications were of the type known as "pulp fiction" and "dime novels."</p>
      <p>Among its pulp fiction periodicals, Street &amp; Smith published adventure and sea stories 
(<emph render="italic">Air Trails</emph>, <emph render="italic">Do and Dare Weekly</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Red Raven Library</emph>, <emph render="italic">Sea Stories Magazine</emph>, <emph render="italic">Tiptop Weekly</emph>); detective and mystery stories 
(<emph render="italic">Clues</emph>, <emph render="italic">Doc Savage</emph>, <emph render="italic">Mystery Story Magazine</emph>, <emph render="italic">Nick Carter Weekly</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Old Broadbrim Weekly</emph>, <emph render="italic">The Shadow</emph>); 
romances (<emph render="italic">Love Story Magazine</emph>, <emph render="italic">Romance Range</emph>); 
science fiction (<emph render="italic">Astounding Stories</emph>, <emph render="italic">Unknown</emph>); 
sports stories (<emph render="italic">All-Sports Library</emph>, <emph render="italic">Athlete</emph>); 
westerns (<emph render="italic">Buffalo Bill Stories</emph>, <emph render="italic">True Western Stories</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Pete Rice Magazine</emph>, <emph render="italic">Western Story Magazine</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Wild West Weekly</emph>); and young adult fiction (<emph render="italic">The Boys of the World</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Bowery Boy Weekly</emph>, <emph render="italic">Live Girl Stories</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">My Queen</emph>).  Many of the authors from Street &amp; Smith's periodicals found their way onto the pages 
of the publisher's dime novels, which were issued in various series, including the Arrow, Bertha Clay, Eagle, Magnet, Medal, and 
Merriwell libraries.  But perhaps the most successful of the dime novels were those issued in the Alger Series, the volumes of which 
promoted the comforting notion that virtue is invariably rewarded by wealth.  (These rags-to-riches tales became so embedded in 
American popular culture that reference to a "Horatio Alger story" became synonymous with the realization of the American dream.)  
Street &amp; Smith comic adventurers included Bill Barnes, Buffalo Bill, Doc Savage, the Red Dragon, and artist R.F. Outcault's Yellow Kid, 
whose first appearance in the New York World in 1895 marked the birth of American comics.  Although Street &amp; Smith specialized in 
pulp fiction periodicals and dime novels, it also published non-fiction periodicals for hobbyists (<emph render="italic">Air Progress</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Air Trails Pictorial</emph>, <emph render="italic">American Modeler</emph>, 
<emph render="italic">Science World</emph>); movie-goers (<emph render="italic">Picture-Play Weekly</emph>); sports enthusiasts 
(<emph render="italic">Pic</emph>, <emph render="italic">Sport Pictorial</emph>, and Baseball, Basketball and Football Yearbooks); 
and women (<emph render="italic">Mademoiselle</emph>, <emph render="italic">You</emph>)</p>

      <p>In 1937 Street &amp; Smith began shrinking their line of pulp titles, ending that genre completely in 1949.  In 1957 
Street &amp; Smith sold their remaining magazine titles to Conde Nast, which acquired the rest of their copyright in 
2007.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>Spanning 1864 to 1972, the <emph render="bold">Street &amp; Smith Records</emph> document the history of the New York City publisher of pulp 
fiction and general interest publications.  Reflecting the wide assortment of these publications, the Street &amp; Smith 
Records have been divided into three parts: Editorial Files by Title, which relate to periodical or established uniform titles 
(a "uniform title" is a collective title used to encompass publications from several different works -- e.g., "Nick Carter 
titles" encompasses titles from the Nick Carter Library, Magnet Library, and Nick Carter radio series); Miscellaneous 
Editorial Files, mostly arranged by format, which refer to books-in-series publications and/or records which are associated 
with more than one periodical title; and Indexes, contained author, title, subject, and other indexes for many of 
Street &amp; Smith's titles.</p>
      
      <p>Supplementing, and in some cases duplicating, the information contained in 
the Editorial files (below), the Library holds 166 boxes of <emph render="bold">Card indexes</emph>.  These 
include manuscript tracer forms, author and 
title indexes for various periodicals, payment verification with reference to 
voucher numbers, printers' records, copyright status reports, and reprint 
notations.  The extent for each set of cards is given in inches, referring to 
how many inches of the box that particular index occupies.  Most indexes are arranged 
alphabetically, but some are chronological and some are not arranged at all.  Some of the card file boxes contain more than one set of index cards.   In that case, an 
index's location within the box is indicated by a slash followed by a number; 
for example, "24/2" indicates that the index is the second run of cards in 
Box 24.</p><p>
        <emph render="bold">Editorial files by title</emph>
      comprise the bulk of the collection.  Characterized by multiple title changes, the Street &amp; Smith periodicals 
reflected, over the course of their publication history, the changing tastes of their readership.  Arranged alphabetically, 
and most closely focused on the 1930s and 1940s, the 
        
        <emph render="bold">Editorial Files by Title</emph> gather 
together all documents relating to a particular periodical and subsequent titles in its volume numbering sequence, 
under the publication's first title.  The exception to this arrangement was the supplying of uniform titles for Horatio 
Alger Jr. and Nick Carter materials, both of which contain original manuscripts as well as a variety of other specialized 
documents.  Beginning with <emph render="italic">Ainslee's</emph> (later 
        <emph render="italic">Ainslee's/Smart Love Stories</emph> and subsequently 
        
        <emph render="italic">Smart Love Stories</emph>), the records encompass a variety of acquisition records 
and financial documents.  These include chronologically arranged manuscripts purchase cards and art and manuscript 
vouchers, which came into use in the late 1930s.  Voucher numbers and, less often, payment amounts are  often indicated 
on the annotated Tables of Contents, which accompany most titles and are found at the end of each group of documents 
relating to a particular title sequence.  Manuscript submissions for each periodical are arranged by title and most often 
followed by the name of the author as it appears on the piece.  Authorship discrepancies are noted and, when discernible, 
pseudonyms are provided.  An example of the organizational pattern follows:</p>

      <p>Editorial practices varied among the different periodical titles, but were 
usually consistent within any given title sequence.  A few editors habitually 
retained an additional copy of the voucher with its corresponding manuscript, 
while others 
 signified acquisition or payment with printed and/or perforated
stamps, the retention of separate notes, or by writing directly on the 
manuscript.  Editorial comment, both in extent and quality, also varies from 
one periodical title to the next.  Some of the manuscripts for particular 
periodical titles have been copyedited, a few are accompanied by reader 
reports which discuss potential suitability for publication, while others 
bear the terse but definitive notation "Impossible."  Such variations in 
editorial practice may suggest a degree of autonomy for Street &amp; Smith's 
periodical editors, or at the very least, a lack of consistent adherence to 
established norms.</p>
      <p>Despite evidence that Street &amp; Smith only loosely controlled editorial 
practice, documentation suggests that accounting principles were strictly 
enforced.  Annual (and occasionally more frequently produced) inventories of 
charged or written off manuscripts and artwork accompany nearly every group 
of documents associated with a particular periodical.  Periodical editors 
were accountable for each manuscript purchase that was unpublished.  In 
addition, having purchased a particular manuscript, Street &amp; Smith 
circulated it repeatedly, sometimes over the course of several decades and 
among various editors, with the hope that one or another could be enticed to 
use it.  The inventories of charged off manuscripts also attest to the re-
assignment of manuscripts to different periodicals, and are frequently 
annotated with suggestions that another editor might find a particular 
submission suitable for inclusion in his publications.  It should be noted 
that the preponderance of manuscripts among the editorial files are those 
which had been written off repeatedly before publication, and that many were 
never used.  However, given its vast array of periodicals and their frequency 
of publication, Street &amp; Smith retained relatively few manuscript 
purchases that weren't eventually published.</p>
      <p>In addition to the manuscripts related to specific periodicals, the 
collection also has a large assortment of material which Street &amp; Smith 
gathered under the term 
        
        <emph render="italic">Miscellaneous manuscripts</emph>.  These submissions, which 
include poems, fiction, non-fiction, and even a sketchbook, were neither 
produced for, nor assigned to, a particular periodical.  A few of these 
manuscripts bear tentative assignments to specific periodical titles, however 
those same manuscript titles are listed among the Miscellaneous manuscripts 
inventories and remain under the heading designated by Street &amp; Smith.  
There are also a number of published stories, many of which originally 
appeared in The Popular Magazine, which were collected under the auspices of 
the Motion Picture Department to promote their potential for production as 
films.</p>
      
      <p>Illuminating both the internal structure of the company as well as its 
day-to-day publishing operations, the 

        
        <emph render="bold">Editorial files, miscellaneous </emph> mostly 
relate to weeklies and books-in-series and include the earliest documentation 
(i.e. Record books 1864-1936) for Street &amp; Smith.  Bent upon cornering 
the fiction market for the expanding literate population, the company 
systematically made purchases of the plate stock of a number of its 
competitors, acquiring such established series as The Ledger Library and The 
Popular Series (Bonner's Sons ), and Golden Hours and the Old Cap. Collier 
Library (N.L. Munro).  Plate stock inventories and orders document the 
successes and the problems associated with such wholesale acquisition.  As 
witness to the importance of the loyalty of its readership to the success of 
the publishing business, Critiques indicate the financial pressure to assign 
acquired material to existing Street &amp; Smith vehicles.  Recognizing the 
widely-held marketing axiom that readers enjoy encountering the same formula 
repeatedly, Street &amp; Smith not only published similar genre stories, but 
also re-issued the material which first appeared in its weeklies in other 
periodicals and as books.  The disbound notebook of the Inventory of series 
as well as the Record books provide evidence that, in an effort to deplete 
its surplus stock, Street &amp; Smith frequently released a given story under 
more than one title merely by binding with a new cover and title page.  
Memoranda concerning the internal inquiries and reports about stock 
illustrate the publisher's commitment to respond quickly to the needs of its 
customers.  A 1939-1940 notebook compilation of information on its 
competitors and distributors testifies to Street &amp; Smith's resolve to 
remain at the forefront of American publishing.</p>
      <p>In addition, the Miscellaneous Editorial Files contain documentation 
relating to Chelsea House books and authors, manuscript transferrals between 
periodicals, and copyright renewals for various series (Border, Eagle, Great 
Western, Magnet, Merriwell).  Financial material encompasses miscellaneous 
(i.e. those not related to a particular periodical) art and manuscripts 
vouchers, arranged by originator or author.  For both its internal record-
keeping and in answer to queries from authors, readers, and collectors, 
Street &amp; Smith compiled lists of authors' stories, which are arranged 
alphabetically.  Conscious of the need for publicity, the publisher issued 
various types of promotional material, including catalogs and price lists 
(1899-1940) and also generated lists of newspapers for review copies.  A 
series of 21 photographs (ca. 1906) document the exterior and interior of the 
79 Seventh Avenue building from which Street &amp; Smith ran its operations 
from 1905.  Perhaps the most poignant items of the collection are the 1949 
clippings from The New Yorker and The New York Times which note the 
suspension of pulp fiction publishing by The Greatest Publishing House in the 
World, the title of Street &amp; Smith's 50th anniversary commemorative 
booklet.</p>
      <p>The 13 record books at the end of this series contain predominantly  publishing and 
statistical information on Street and Smith weeklies and books-in-series 
publications between 1864 and 1936 (the date range indicated for each record book is approximate).  
Pagination occasionally varies 
(Record Books 12, 13), and there is some overlapping and duplication 
of information from one record book to another.  Blank pages have not 
been filmed.  Prepared for the specialized needs of the publisher, the 
first volume has running series titles with column headings for issue 
number, date of publication, author (with space for "nom de plume"), 
title, and sub-title.  Later record books were originally accounting 
ledgers, for which column headings have been changed and/or added by 
hand.  Entered in ink as well as pencil, the variations in handwriting, 
as well as legibility, indicate that the notations were recorded by 
several different individuals.  While the series are arranged in 
numerical and publishing sequence, the lists may be continued in the 
same or subsequent record books.</p>
      <p>Although not usually noted in the record books, when title 
changes occur within a weekly series, all the titles represented 
by that title sequence and their corresponding numbers (which 
sometimes extend beyond the contents of that particular record book) 
are provided.  The periodical titles used here are from the covers of 
the publications; other titles may appear on the Contents pages or as 
running titles.  The use of brackets for both weeklies and books-in-series 
publications represents an attempt to standardize the working titles 
used in the record books.</p><p><emph render="bold">Films</emph> contains more than 200 films or film fragments related to a single episode of The Shadow, entitled "The Case of the Cotton Kimono."</p>

   <note><p>The extent for each set of cards is given in inches, referring to 
how many inches of the box that particular index occupies.  Some of the card file boxes contain more than one set of index cards.   In that case, an 
index's location within the box is indicated by a slash followed by a number; 
for example, "24/2" indicates that the index is the second run of cards in 
Box 24.</p></note><c02 id="card-ga"><did><unittitle>General author index </unittitle><unitdate>1915-1938</unitdate></did>

            <scopecontent><p>There are three different Nick Carter title sequences, each with its own numbering, but they are most often referred to in the Record Books as simply "Nick Carter." As they first appear in the Record Books, the title sequences are: [1] Nick Carter Detective Library/ Nick Carter Library; [2] New Nick Carter Library/New Nick Carter Weekly/ Nick Carter Weekly/New Nick Carter Weekly; and [3] Nick Carter Stories (Record Book 3). Similarly, the Tip Top series has two distinct numbering sequences: Tip Top Weekly/Tip Top Library/Tip Top Weekly; and: New Tip Top Weekly (Record Book 3).</p></scopecontent>
