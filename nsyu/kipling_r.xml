      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Joseph Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) was an English author and poet.  His best-known works include 
the novels and short story collections 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Jungle Book</emph> (1894), 

        
        <emph render="italic">Just So Stories</emph> (1902), 
        
        <emph render="italic">Puck of Pook's Hill</emph> (1906),
 and 
        
        <emph render="italic">Kim</emph> (1901), as well as a number of poems such as "Mandalay" (1890), "Gunga 
Din" (1890), and "If--" (1910).</p>
      <p>Kipling was born in Bombay, India, into an artistic 
family: his father was a sculptor, pottery designer, and professor of architectural sculpture and two of 
his aunts were married to painters (Georgiana to Edward Burne-Jones and Agnes to Edward Poynter).   At the 
age of six and he his sister were sent back to England to school, as was common with the children of 
British colonial India.  After six unsatisfactory years with a Mr. and Mrs. Holloway, Rudyard and Trix 
were taken in by their aunt Georgiana.  </p>
      <p>Kipling attended the United Services College in Devon and 
then went to Lahore in what is now Pakistan to become assistant editor of a small newspaper.  In addition 
to editing, Kipling contributed a great many stories to the paper (approximately 39 in one year) and 
several travel sketches.  In 1889 Kipling returned to London via a roundabout eight-month journey that 
took him to  Rangoon, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan, and various cities in the United States and Canada.  
Upon his arrival in London he began building a reputation as a writer, publishing two novels in two years 
along with several short stories.</p>
      <p>In 1892 Kipling married Carrie Balestier and shortly thereafter 
the couple moved to the United States, settling in Vermont, where Kipling began writing the 

        
        <emph render="italic">Jungle Book</emph> stories and produced four novels in four years. In July 1899, 
despite their pleasant life in Vermont, Kipling decided to return to England and came to Torquay on 
the Devon coast.  Kipling soon earned a reputation as "the poet of the Empire" and when he and his family 
paid a Christmas visit to the British colonies in South Africa (which became an annual tradition) they were 
warmly received.  </p>
      <p>In 1907 Kipling was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature "in consideration of 
the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration 
which characterize the creations of this world-famous author," becoming the first English-language 
recipient.</p>
      <p>After World War I, during which Kipling's only son John was killed, he wrote (1923) a 
two-volume history of his son's regiment, the Irish Guards, which is considered to be one of the finest 
examples of regimental history.  He also became a "roving correspondent" for the British press.  Among his 
other occupations, in 1922 he developed "The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer" for the University of 
Toronto, a statement of duties and responsibilities to be recited by graduates in engineering; the ritual 
is sometimes called the Kipling Ritual and is still in use today.  In 1925 he became Lord Rector of St. 
Andrews University in Scotland, though his writing began to slow somewhat in the late 1920s and early 1930s.</p>
      <p>Kipling died in 1936 and his ashes were interred in Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey, in the company 
of other luminaries of British literature including Geoffrey Chaucer, Edmund Spenser, Charles Dickens, 
Thomas Hardy, and Alfred Lord Tennyson.</p>
      <p>Samuel S. McClure (18570-1949) and Herbert Henry McClure (died 1938) were cousins and members of 
		a publishing family, who founded the first American newspaper syndicate.  Together they lauinched 
		and/or supported numerous authors including Willa Cather, Booth Tarkington, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 
		and Charles Dana Gibson.  H.H. McClure counted Kipling amond his personal friends.  E.W. (Ernest 
		Walter) Martindell (1873-1951) was a British lawyer, member of the Royal Anthropological Institute, 
		and Kipling's first bibliographer.  No information can be found about Alan D. Wilson.</p>

		  (Somerset Maugham, Frederick W. Childs) collaborators (Louise Sington, who set some of Kipling's 
		  verse to music), and  relatives (aunts, uncles, cousins). There is also some correspondence of 
		  Kipling's close family (wife, parents, children) and a small amount of correspondence between 
		  third parties.</p>
