         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>Based on information in the collection and a moderate amount of online research, 
	  this material appears to be connected with the family of Gavin  (1771-1830) and Janet 
	  (1780-1863) Morton of Darvel in Ayrshire, Scotland.   Gavin was a weaver, and the 
	  Morton family in general appears to have been in that trade for many years, as the name 
	  of Morton appears in the history of textiles in Darvel and nearby Kilmarnock (see for 
	  example the records of <extref href="https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/d7af3384-8448-3021-9dcb-9cbc7e523669">Blackwood, Morton &amp; Sons</extref>).</p>
	  
	  <p>Gavin and Janet had eight children: William, John, James, Gavin, Thomas, Robert, 
	  Marion, and Janet.  The five youngest Mortons emigrated to the United States during 
	  the mid-1800s and at least three of them settled in the Central New York region.  
	  Gavin (wife Janet) and Marion (husband John Findlay) settled in Skaneateles, New York.   
	  Thomas and his wife Margaret (Mitchell) settled in Mottville, New York; he eventually 
	  became the owner of at least two woollen mills.</p>
	  
	  <p>Agnes Mitchell Armitage Thompson (1822-1893) was also from Darvel.  She marrried 
	  twice and had six children. the first two of whom were born in Mexico where her first 
	  husband, David Armitage, was involved in a woollen mill venture and later in silver 
	  mining.  Her connection with the Morton family cannot be established for certain; a 
	  reasonable guess is that she was the sister of Margaret Mitchell, Thomas Morton's wife.</p>

         <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
         <p>The <emph render="bold">Morton Family Papers</emph> consists of personal and business material.  The entire collection consists of photocopies.  There are no originals.</p>
			
			<p><emph render="bold">Personal material</emph> contains a few pages of genealogical material and several folders of correspondence amongst members of the Morton family in Scotland and America, including siblings William, John, James, Gavin, Thomas, Robert, Marion, and Janet Morton; their parents Gavin and Janet; and their children.  There are also letters from friends and relatives, including Agnes Mitchell Armitage, her father John Mitchell, her second husband Jared Thompson, and her children Albert and Jennie.</p><p>The letters are chatty, consisting mostly of family news, inquiries,  and gossip.      In a letter dated 16 May 1847 from Darvel, John Morton writes: "Dear Brother Robert, our Brother Gaven his wife and family and our sister Janet all sailed for amaruca on the first of april the should be landed with you by this time if all have gone well with them our mother laments there loss veray much as shee is left alone."        In another letter to "Dear Mr. Morton" dated 1 Jan 1853, Cordelia (surname unknown) writes: "I stopt in Oriskany on my way down George was well said he would give me a loom any time that I wanted to go to work but I had rather go back to Skaneateles that is if every thing was right" and later she inquires "How does Martha get along? Has she left her Husband yet?"</p><p>The bulk of the letters are dated from locations in New York, including Mottville,  Throopsville, Whitney's Point, Cazenovia, Ithaca, Utica, and Syracuse.  Outside of New York, there is correspondence from Plattsville and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and from Kansas City, Missouri.</p><p><emph render="bold">Business records</emph> appear to relate mostly to Thomas Mott's textile businesses, including the Aberdeen Woollen Mills.  It contains accounts payable, accounts receivable, insurance and tax paperwork, and 
			a small amount of correspondence.</p>
