      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Sylvia Carewe (1906-1981) was an American painter and poet.</p><p>Born in New York City to Russian 
immigrant parents, Louis and Esther Kerewsky, she changed her surname to "Carewe" in 1930.  Carewe attended Columbia University and studied further with Yaso Kuniyoshi at 
Atelier 17 in New York, with Hans Hoffman in New York and Provincetown, 
Massachusetts, and at the New School for Social Research.</p>
      <p>During 
World War II Carewe worked as an advertising copywriter and artist for agencies in 
New York. She became a prolific abstract 
artist in a range of media, including tapestry designs for the Aubusson carpet company in France, 
felt banners, collage reliefs, and what she termed "blown 
paintings,"  which were assemblages (predominantly of children's toy components) overlaid 
with spray paint.   She also worked  in traditional artistic media, including watercolors, oils, 
lithographs and pastels.   In October 1944, she married 
Marvin Small (formerly Smallheiser, executive for Carter's Little Liver Pills).  They had one child, John Marvin, in June 
1947.</p>
      <p>Carewe had her first one-woman show in Poughkeepsie in 1947, after which she opened in New 
York City at the ACA Gallery in 1948. She had some twenty other American solo shows and her works hung in many exhibits across the United States as well as in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Her 
works are represented in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum, Mus√©e 
de l'Arte Moderne, Paris, Brandeis University, the Butler Art Institute, Howard 
University, the Tel Aviv Museum and the National Museum in Djakarta, Indonesia.  Her work has been described by French critics as "violent, colorful art, in hard contrasts, not exempt from cold lyricism." ["Les Girls," 
        
        <emph render="italic">Time</emph>, 11 Nov 1957]  Carewe was nearly as productive as a writer, producing both poetry and short stories.</p>

    <scopecontent encodinganalog="520">
      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Sylvia Carewe Papers</emph> contains biographical information, 
correspondence, legal material, vocational material (professional literary, advertising, and art work), 
published material, memorabilia, and an enormous number of photographic reproductions (prints, photographic 
negatives, color transparencies, and slides) of Carewe's art.</p>

      <p><emph render="bold">Biographical information</emph> includes documentation pertaining to Carewe's 
		marriage and several biographical sketches, along with a chronology provided by Carewe.</p>
		
		<p><emph render="bold">Correspondence</emph> makes up a very small portion of the collection, with 
		only about 40 items.  It is largely business or family birthday remembrances.   </p>
		
		<p><emph render="bold">Legal material</emph>, also quite small, consists mostly of valuations of 
		Carewe's and her husband's art collection.</p>
		
		<p><emph render="bold">Vocation</emph> contains material relating to Carewe's professional literary 
		and artistic output, including   short stories, advertising copy, sketches, over a hundred poems, 
		and the draft of a book titled <emph render="italic">Women, money and divorce</emph>, which 
		appears to be autobiographical.</p>
		
		<p><emph render="bold">Published material</emph> consists mostly of clippings from newspapers and magazines.  
		There is also one book on contemporary artists of the time.</p>
		
		<p><emph render="bold">Memorabilia</emph> contains a scrapbook, date book, an award from the 
		 War Food Administration, and miscellaneous other items.</p>		
		
		<p>The bulk of the collection consists of several hundred  <emph render="bold">Photographs</emph> of Carewe's works.  These reproductions  
		-- prints, negatives, color transparencies, and 
		slides -- give a very full picture of the breadth of her stylistic range but unfortunately, very few 
		are titled or dated. There are also a few images of Carewe and her husband and friends.</p>

            <p>Of the nearly 400 slides, 276 show works by Carewe 
either in full or in detail.
Because only some are titled by the artist, they have been loosely organized by 
style into 10 groups:
1) Beach paintings (possibly done at Provincetown, MA), 2) portraits, 3) more realistic paintings, 4) more abstract paintings, 5) "Mother Scenes", 
6) "white" paintings, 7) "blown" paintings, 8) lights and night paintings, 9) miscellaneous, 
and 10) family, friends and travel. In many cases there are 2 copies of each slide.</p>
