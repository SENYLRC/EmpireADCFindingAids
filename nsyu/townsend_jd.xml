      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>John D. Townsend (1835-1896) was an American lawyer and author who wrote



        <emph render="italic">New York in Bondage</emph> (1901).</p>
      <p>John Drake Townsend was born in New York City in 1835.  His father, John R. Townsend, was an attorney in the city.  His father was also the first President of the New York Life and Trust Company.  John D. Townsend entered Columbia College at the age of thirteen, but his college career was short-lived.  By the age of twenty, he was the second officer of "The Flying Cloud," a clipper ship that made headlines when it sailed from New York to San Francisco in only 89 days.</p>
      <p>Townsend married Miss Delano Swan with whom he had four daughters.  Due to financial difficulties, Townsend turned his attention to law, studying with Messrs. Sprague and Fillmore for three years followed by two years at the Dane Law School of Harvard University.  He was admitted to the New York State Bar in May 1859.</p>
      <p>The lawyer served in the Queens County Legislature before being asked by Governor Morgan to serve on a committee responsible for organizing a war regiment from Townsend's Senatorial district.  He went on to act as a delegate to the Democratic State Convention on numerous occasions.  Townsend earned the reputation of being "The Fighting Lawyer," and was eventually chosen to serve as the sole attorney for William "Boss" Tweed.  He was later selected by the Assembly Committee to oversee the examination of the District Attorney's office, the Police Department, and various other branches of the city government.</p>
      <p>Townsend died on Christmas night, 1896 during a dinner party given by friends.</p>
