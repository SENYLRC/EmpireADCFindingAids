      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Gerrit Smith (1797-1874) was an American social reformer, abolitionist, politician, and philanthropist.  Born in Utica, New York, he spent much of his life in nearby Peterboro.  Smith's grandfather, Colonel James Livingston, fought in the American Revolution and his first cousin, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was a founder and leader of the women's suffrage movement.  Smith was non-sectarian in his religious views, active in the temperance movement, an avid and outspoken abolitionist (he was a financial backer of John Brown of Kansas, whose raid on Harper's Ferry nearly led to Smith's prosecution), and three times ran for President of the United States.  His philanthropic gifts  are said to have exceeded $8 million over his lifetime.  Although he rarely ventured far 
afield from his central New York village, and spent less than two years in 
elected public office, his biographer Ralph Volney Harrow says, "He and a few 
others like him furnished the oratory, the written propaganda, and the 
emotional fervor necessary to keep good causes constantly before the public" 
(Harlow, Ralph Volney, 
        
        <emph render="italic">Gerrit Smith, Philanthropist and Reformer</emph>, New York, 
Henry Holt and Co., 1939, p.v.)</p>
      <p>Gerrit Smith was born at Utica, New York, 1797, one of the six children of 
Peter and Elizabeth Livingston Smith. Peter was a successful businessman, a 
partner of John Jacob Astor in the fur trade, and owner of vast estates in 
New York State. These included 20,000 acres in the Mohawk Valley and a 
continuous tract of more than 60,000 acres in northern Madison County. In 
1806 when Gerrit was nine years old, Peter moved his family to his Madison 
County preserves and named the village he established there Peterboro.</p>
      <p>Gerrit entered Hamilton College in 1814 and graduated as valedictorian in 
1818. In January of the following year he married Wealtha Ann Backus, 
daughter of Hamilton's president.  Wealtha Ann died seven months after the 
wedding, and in 1822, Gerrit married Ann Carroll Fitzhugh of Rochester, New 
York. There were four children of this union: Elizabeth, born September 20, 
1822; Fitzhugh, born October 18, 1824 and died July 1836; Ann, born July 7, 
1830 and died April 1835; and Green, born April 14, 1842.</p>
      <p>In 1818 Gerrit purchased 18,000 acres of land in Oneida County. The 
following year his father Peter turned over responsibility for the management 
of all his property to Gerrit and Gerrit's uncle, Daniel Cady. Gerrit moved 
into the "mansion house" in Peterboro, thus at age twenty-one assuming 
responsibility not only for the extensive lands in central New York, but also 
as "patron" for the village of Peterboro.  By 1823 value of his purchase in 
Oneida County had increased and he took his first step in philanthropy, never 
ceasing from then until his death to provide funds generously for public 
causes, particularly those he considered "moral."</p>
      <p>When Peter Smith died in 1837, he held some 556,000 acres of land in 43 
counties of New York State.  His will directed that the property should be 
sold and the proceeds divided among his son Peter Skenandoah, the children of 
his daughter Cornelia, and Gerrit.  Gerrit gained the consent of the other 
heirs to maintain the property and bought out their shares for cash.</p>
      <p>Gerrit Smith was something of a hypochondriac and imagined himself ill for 
most of his life. However, according to Harlow, "In the course of his life he 
had printed approximately two hundred circular letters, speeches, and 
pamphlets, dealing with the various questions, political, social, and 
theological, in which he happened to be interested. Then he kept a close 
oversight of his voluminous correspondence, both general and business, as the 
numerous notes and endorsements in his own hand show. He also wrote out 
drafts of replies for his clerks to copy. His land books carried about 
fifteen, hundred separate accounts, which ran on year after year. All these 
were in addition to the numerous transactions in which he bought or sold land 
for cash. Much of the routine work in connection with these accounts was done 
by his clerks, but Smith was always an observant employer.' (Harlow, pp.33, 
35)</p>
      <p>In addition to his land interests, in the 1830s Gerrit Smith was a 
director of the Utica branch of the Bank of the United States, held a 
franchise for the mail stage between Utica and Peterboro, and owned 
considerable stock in the Hudson and Mohawk Railroad, forerunner of the New 
York Central, During the 1840s, he helped to reorganize the Commercial Bank 
of Oswego and to promote the Syracuse and Oswego Railroad. One of his early 
ventures in business had been the purchase of 91 of the total 100 shares in 
the Oswego Canal Company, which proved to be one of his most profitable 
business investments, and during the 1840s, he also worked actively to 
prevent discriminatory rates on the Canal. Before he was fifty, then, he was 
a landholder of large estates, ¡r businessman, and a citizen of reputation as 
one ready to espouse business and commercial enterprises of public 
concern.</p>
      <p>The record indicates, however, that Gerrit Smith's most significant 
contributions to his era were his efforts in the causes of social and moral 
reform. He used his powers of oratory and his ability to write on 
controversial issues on behalf of anti-slavery, anti-tobacco, and anti-
Masonic movements; temperance, women's rights; religion; education; and 
international peace. His gifts to these causes were divided roughly into 
three categories: speaking, writing both for publication and privately, and 
providing funds.</p>
      <p>One of Gerrit Smith's earliest concerns was religion, and he claimed its 
precepts as the basis of his reform efforts throughout his life. He was 
involved in the work of the American Bible Society, the American Tract 
Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Home Missionary 
Society. After he became interested in abolition, he thought Protestant 
denominationalism was wrong because he believed the churches, as 
organizations, were not taking a "sufficient" stand against slavery. He was 
instrumental in forming non-denominational churches in Oswego and 
Peterboro.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the first significant reform movement espoused by Smith was that 
of temperance. He was a member of the New York Temperance Society and spoke 
at its first annual meeting in January 1830, to the effect that alcohol was 
responsible for most of the crime and poverty in the world. He established a 
"temperance hotel" in Peterboro, where no liquor was sold or consumed, and 
had an interest in similar hostelries in Oswego and Utica. In 1833, he 
attended the National Temperance Convention of the American Temperance 
Society in Philadelphia, where he spoke at meetings, introduced resolutions, 
and wrote circular letters. He attacked with his oratory distilleries in 
Cazenovia and Eton, neighbors of Peterboro, and apparently "cleaned up" 
Peterboro, which "went dry" in 1846, following passage of the New York option 
law on the licensing of liquor sales.</p>
      <p>As Smith's reputation as both reformer and philanthropist grew' he was 
besieged by founders of societies and organizations devoted to one or another 
of the social reforms, both for funds and for the support of his name. He 
either became a member of, wrote circular letters for, provided funds to--or 
all three--societies fighting the use of tobacco, vegetarian groups, 
societies to save the souls of canal workers, supporters of sexual purity' 
the American Peace Society, the Seamen's Friends Society, and organizations 
devoted to limiting the control of the federal government over canals, 
railroads' schools, and internal improvements. He supported women's rights 
movements, including Amelia Bloomer's drive for reform in women's dress, and 
responded with speeches, funds, and letters to requests for help from 
feminists Lucy Stone; Susan B. Anthony; his cousin, Elizabeth Cady Stanton; 
and his own wife and daughter Elizabeth, both of whom became active in the 
women's rights movement.</p>
      <p>In December 1831, Benjamin Lundy, the Quaker publisher of the journal 
        
        <emph render="italic">The 
Genius of Emancipation</emph>, visited Gerrit Smith in Peterboro, the first of many 
abolitionists to be entertained there over the ensuing years. For about four 
years, Smith remained more of an observer than active supporter of the more 
militant anti-slavery groups, but by the mid-thirties he had become an avowed 
abolitionist. He attended the convention in Utica In 1835 where the New York 
State Anti-Slavery Society was born, and from that time to the Civil War and 
beyond, he was a committed and articulate member of the country's anti-
slavery forces. The Utica meeting was broken up by a mob of anti-
abolitionists and Smith was appointed chairman of a committee to decide on 
the place and time of the next meeting; it reconvened in Peterboro the next 
day.</p>
      <p>Gerrit Smith was elected president of the New York State Anti-Slavery 
Society in 1836, and began publication of approximately fifty essays on 
slavery printed in the form of circular letters. By the decade of the 1830s 
he also was helping slaves to escape and sheltering them at Peterboro before 
sending them on, usually to Canada.  In some cases, he bought slaves and set 
them free.</p>
      <p>The Liberty Party was born in Albany, New York, on April 1, 1840, on the 
basis of pledges by its members not to support pro-slavery candidates for 
office. Although he refused the party's nomination as a gubernatorial 
candidate in 1842, Gerrit Smith spoke at conventions, wrote his circular 
letters, gave his financial support, and seems to have had considerable 
influence in the party. He was nominated as a presidential candidate in 1848 
by the National Liberty Party, the Liberty League, and the Industrial 
Congress. In New York State, Smith polled 2,545 votes out of more than 
500,000, the moderate abolitionists of the state giving 120,510 votes to 
Martin Van Buren.</p>
      <p>Combining his interests in land reform and in free labor as opposed to 
slavery, Gerrit Smith gave parcels of his lands, the greater part in the 
Adirondacks, to thousands of poor white and black families to give them a 
start as farmers. He also granted lands to 196 white families in Madison 
County, with an additional thousand grants going to other inhabitants of New 
York State.</p>
      <p>In 1853 Gerrit Smith was elected to Congress, representing the 22nd New 
York District of Oswego and Madison counties. He was supported by anti-
slavery Whigs, Democrats, Free Democrats, and other abolitionists. While an 
incumbent, he strongly advocated temperance, abolition, and peace, and fought 
the Kansas-Nebraska-Bill. But he resigned his seat in August 1854, giving as 
his reason "the pressure of my too extensive private business.</p>
      <p>Gerrit Smith was caught up in the Kansas Aid movement, becoming its leader 
in Madison County and pledging more than $3000 to help pour anti-slavery 
settlers from the North into the-territory in order to secure a free state. 
He was active in supporting the "free soilers" of Kansas in their sometimes 
bloody battles with the Missouri slave-holders, who were determined to make 
Kansas a slave state.</p>
      <p>John Brown had been a leader for free soil in Kansas, but by 1857 the 
Kansas troubles had lessened, and Brown turned his thoughts to an attack on 
Virginia and the colonization of free-soilers there. He traveled about from 
place to place seeking funds, and arrived in Peterboro in February 1858' 
where he discussed his plans with Gerrit Smith and others. Documents indicate 
that Smith understood perfectly what John Brown had in mind and that it would 
involve violence. The attack on Harper's Ferry began on 0ctober 16, 1859. 
Brown was captured; charged with conspiracy, murder and treason; found 
guilty; sentenced; and hanged in early December.</p>
      <p>During this period, the 
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Herald</emph> printed documents disclosing 
Smith's connection with John Brown and his plot, and accused Smith of being 
an accessory. Smith's fear and anxiety over the possible effects of his 
involvement resulted in a nervous breakdown. Five days after John Brown was 
sentenced, Gerrit Smith was taken to the New York State Lunatic Asylum in 
Utica, where he remained for about two months before he was returned to 
Peterboro. He consistently denied any more than the most superficial 
knowledge of Brown's plans and activities and brought libel suits against 
those who published attacks on him. However, he settled out of court in 
preference to having his close connection with John Brown publicized through 
the documents held by his accusers.</p>
      <p>For a year after his breakdown, Smith withdrew from public life and lived 
in retirement; he then resumed his activities in defense of the slaves.  He 
ran for the United States presidency on an abolitionist ticket in 1861 but, 
while voting for himself, supported Lincoln and gave the administration his 
full approval once the Civil War had begun. Although he sometimes criticized 
Lincoln's attitude toward slavery, he made speeches and wrote public letters 
upholding the government. He advocated Negro suffrage but was in favor of 
making literacy a prerequisite of the ballot. He advocated bail for Jefferson 
Davis and, with Horace Greeley and Cornelius Vanderbilt, signed Davis' bail 
bond.</p>
      <p>Gerrit Smith emerged from the Civil War a Republican. By the 1870's he had 
become active in the party and a supporter of business enterprise. At age 75, 
he was a delegate to the National Republican convention in Philadelphia, and 
even supported Ulysses S. Grant in spite of Grant's indulgence in liquor and 
Smith's abhorrence of alcohol In his late years, Gerrit Smith continued to 
contribute funds liberally to any cause he thought worthwhile. He spent 
freely for his own village of Peterboro, providing for flagstone walks, swamp 
drainage, and the building of roads. He reopened the Peterboro Academy, 
providing a site for it in the village as well as a salary budget and free 
tuition for needy students. He gave money to Cornell University, Hampton 
Institute, Howard University, Alfred University, and finally, in the last 
year of his life, $10,000 to his alma mater, Hamilton College, although for 
many years he had disapproved of its policies and refused to have anything to 
do with it except to criticize.</p>
      <p>Gerrit Smith died suddenly on December 28, 1874, in New York City, where 
he had gone to spend Christmas with his nephew, John Cochrane. He was buried 
in Peterboro. The 
        
        <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> of December 29 commented: "The history of 
the most important half century of our national life will be imperfectly 
written if it fails to place Gerrit Smith in the front rank of the men whose 
influence was most felt in the accomplishment of its results without official 
participation in politics, beyond a single session in Congress, he was active 
and powerful in forming the public sentiment that controlled 
politicians."</p>
