      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>The Garo people call themselves A'chik Mande with a'chik meaning "hill people"
            and mande meaning "people." The name "Garo" was given to people of
            the Assam and Meghalaya states of India who lived south of the Brahamputra river by
            outsiders. Today Garo means the hill tribes who call themselves A'chik or Mande. The
            Garo people settled in the hills of Assam and Meghalaya states of India. This section of
            India is situated between Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Arunachal Pradesh. Until the 18th
            century, this matrilineal society passed down their histories, customs, and beliefs
            through the oral tradition. </p>
      <p>Born in Leeds, England in 1878, Rev. Frederick W. Harding (1878-1975) graduated from
            Hamilton Theological seminary in 1907 becoming an ordained Baptist minister. Shortly
            after being ordained, he traveled to Tura, Meghalaya, India to begin ministering. By
            1919 he set up the A'chik Theological College, which became the Harding Theological
            College, then (as it is known today) the American Baptist Missionary. Harding, other
            Christian missionaries, and British officials came to the Assam and Meghalaya region in
            late 19th and early 20th century to govern the people of this region and convert the
            polytheistic people to monotheistic Christianity.</p>
      <p>Major A. Playfair (b. 1868) was the Deputy Commissioner of Eastern Bengal and Assam during
            the early 20th century. In 1909 he wrote a book entitled 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Garos</emph> which was
            published under the orders of the Government of Eastern Bengal and Assam. His monograph
            on the Garo people in pre-independent India is still considered one of the most
            comprehensive work on them. </p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The 
        
        <emph render="bold">Frederick W. Harding Collection relating to the Garo
               People</emph> has been largely left in its original order. Some attempt had evidently
            been made to organize the material; based on handwriting and folder age, this was
            probably not done by Harding. However, given the uncertainty, this organization has been
            preserved with the exception of placing scholarly evaluations of the collection at the
            beginning. Thus, the organization is as follows: Evaluations, I. Introduction, II.
            Domestic life, III. Laws and customs, IV. Religion, V. Folklore, VI. Language, VII.
            Miscellaneous, and VIII. Education, Literature, Mission, The Reforms.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of each series, the original organizer listed what should be found in
            that section, but this information is not always consistent or accurate. Reserachers are
            encouraged to thoroughly investigate the collection.</p>
      <p>Throughout the collection, Harding's and Playfair's names are written on pages,
            suggesting they used the material for research; there are also notes glued to some pages
            that were written and signed by Harding. </p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">Evaluations</emph> consist of two evaluations of the collection, one completed by Ernest Becker
            in 1959 and the other by University of Pennsylvania's Robbins Burling in 1961. In their opinions, the
            collection will be invaluable to individuals researching the Garo language since there
            are many items completely in Garo with no translation.</p>
      <p>The original organizer's list for 
        
        <emph render="bold">I. Introduction</emph> includes habitat,
            appearance, physical and general characteristics, origin, divisions, affinities, dress,
            tattooing, jewelry, and weapons. Instead, the series includes origin stories and history
            by the Garo people, a history of the Garo people by the British, information on the
            Hazangs and Koaches, a migration story in Garo, relationships between Garo people and
            between the Garo tribe and other tribes, and so on.</p>
      <p>The original organizer's list for 
        
        <emph render="bold">II. Domestic life</emph> includes occupation,
            agriculture, houses, villages, furniture and household utensils, musical instruments,
            crops, hunting, fishing, food, drink, games, dancing, and manufactures. This series is
            small and contains suicide statistics for 1903-1905, names of dances, instructions on
            making cloths, and botanical identification.</p>
      <p>For 
        
        <emph render="bold">III. Laws and customs</emph>, the content is close to the original organizer's list. The
            organizer intended the series to contain information on tribal organization, marriage,
            divorce, inheritance, adoption, tenure of land, decision of disputes, and head hunting,
            which the series does. Other subjects are property rights, religious beliefs, ceremonies,
            mythology, the Garo's custom of Dai, and so on.</p>
      <p>Within 
        
        <emph render="bold">IV. Religion</emph>, the original list included
            the general character of popular beliefs, ancestor worship, worship of
            natural forces, worship of deities, sacrificial stones, memorial posts (Kimas),
            divination, priesthood, ceremonies and custom attending birth and naming of children,
            ceremonies attending marriage, beliefs concerning death, disposal of dead, genna, and
            dreams and superstitions. The series does include information on priests and ceremonies,
            but it also contains a case of trial by ordeal, “Kosis,” reincarnation, and other
            information.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">V. Folklore</emph> had no list of intended contents,
            possibly because this series contains the most Garo throughout the entire collection.
            Proverbs, song, and stories are transcribed by Garo individuals in the Garo language
            with few stories written in English.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">VI. Language</emph> series contains one item, Linguistic 1898 Survey, which was completed by G.A.
            Grierson, Esq. for the Deputy Commissioner of the Garo Hills.</p>
      <p>
        <emph render="bold">VII. Miscellaneous</emph> was listed as containing teknonymy,
            miscell and general, Kala-azar, calendar: days of the week, names of months, and
            criticisms of Playfair's 
        
        <emph render="italic">The Garos</emph>. The series is close to
            their original intention. There is information on "Kala-azar" and the
            agricultural season, but also annual reports, a long-typed copy of a text, and other
            information. </p>
      <p>The last series, 
        
        <emph render="bold">VIII. Education, Literature, Mission, The Reforms</emph>, matches the
            original organizer's list. Harding created a school at Tura, information on which is in the first folder.
            There are also reports, information on the Reforms, and so on. </p>
      <p>As the researcher explores the collection, they will find that there are inconsistencies
            in the original organizer's intended filing. As such, when using this collection, the
            researcher is encouraged to investigate the collection in its entiraty so as to not over
            look important items.</p>
