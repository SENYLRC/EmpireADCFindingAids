      <head>Biographical History</head>
      <p>Henry B. Walker was a native of Cooperstown, New York who served with the 121st New York Volunteers during the Civil War.  
	  He received a battlefield commission as a lieutenant at Marye's Heights, Virginia, on April 30, 1863, in action which was part 
	  of the battle of Chancellorsville, being wounded in the left shoulder on the same day.  He spent the period of the Gettysburg 
	  campaign in hospital in Washington, D.C., and returned to his regiment after Lee retreated behind the Rappahannock and Rapidan 
	  rivers in Virginia.  He was active in the maneuvers of the army in that area during the fall of 1863.  Early in 1864 he was 
	  discharged from the army, returning to his home near Cooperstown.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents of the Collection</head>
      <p>The <emph render="bold">Henry B. Walker Letters</emph> (January 1863 - March 1864) consist of 43 outgoing letters from 
	  Union soldier Henry B. Walker.  Though addressed and sent to members of his family, 
	  they were apparently intended for general circulation among his friends at home.  The letters primarily contain descriptions of 
	  his life in the army camp, at the hospital after he was wounded, and during the maneuvers of the army around the Rappahannock 
	  and Rapidan rivers.  The letters include descriptions of tents, food, marches, illnesses, the excitement of battle and the tedium 
	  of camp life, as well as friendships, religious services, and political and military opinions.</p>
	  <p>The bulk of the letters originate from the following Virginia locations: White Oak Church, Falmouth, Potomac Creek Bridge 
	  Station, Balford Heights, New Baltimore, Warrenton, Culpepper, Cedar Mountain, Mitchell Station, Rappahannock Station, 
	  and Welford's Ford.  There are three letters from Georgetown in Washington, D.C. (while Walker was in hospital).  The last 
	  three letters are written from Elmdale, New York after he arrived home, and are accompanied by transcripts.</p>
