         <head>Biographical History</head>
         
      <p>The Research and Design Institute (1965-1976) was inspired by John F. Kennedy's 
challenge: "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."  
Fifty Rhode Island civic leaders created the RDI to support economic development in New England 
by conducting design research to improve the quality of life.  Ronald Beckman, vice-president of 
the design firm George Nelson and Co., was appointed director and G. William Miller, president 
of Textron Corporation, was elected Chairman of the Board.  U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell helped 
secure start-up funds from the Federal Area Redevelopment Agency and a matching state grant was 
approved by Rhode Island governor John H. Chaffee.  The initial staff of nine included business 
manager Eric J. M. Godfrey, architects John Beynon and Jan Terezczenko, industrial designers 
Ronald Jacob and Howard Yarme, cultural anthropologist William Azano, and a secretarial staff 
of three.  During its most active periods, the staff tripled in size.</p>

<p>The institute's goal was to demonstrate superior environments -- designing schools, housing, 
medical facilities, urban places and workspaces that would attract an entrepreneurial population 
to Rhode Island and promote economic growth.  In 1967 Beckman received the first graphic 
design grant awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to advance highway 
communication and safety.  With New York University, RDI assembled a site for "Design-In," an 
environmental conference held in Central Park in 1968.  A hospital interior to support Progressive 
Patient Care was completed in southern Rhode Island in 1969, and one of the first open-plan 
office interiors in America was installed for B.A. Ballou Company of East Providence in 1970.  
More than 20 different projects were undertaken for colleges and universities, and the Institute 
completed master plans for three high schools, four elementary schools, and the Rhode Island 
School for the Deaf.  Designs for education were based on a national survey of outstanding 
elementary schools commissioned by the Educational Facilities Laboratory of the Ford Foundation.</p>

<p>A program established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), entitled "Socio/Physical Design," allowed the institute to design environments  in response to research findings 
on large federal projects.  The institute collaborated with architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata, and 
Kassabaum on a proposal for the American Pavilion in Osaka, Japan (1972); the Smithsonian National 
Air and Space Museum (1973-1975); and the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport highway network (1975).</p>

<p>After completing over 50 projects, the central mission of the institute shifted to conservation 
and alternative energy technology.  With a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the 
institute developed a solar electric/solar heated daycare center engineered by Professor Joseph 
Loferski and his graduate students at Brown University (1975-1979).  Another project was a large solar 
collector and wind power demonstration at the UAW Education Center in northern Michigan (1976).  
Funded by the NEA, RDI prototyped an alternative energy expo for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota.  In the last years of its operation, the institute poured all its efforts into the 
renovation of the 17th century Stillman White Brass Foundry in Providence, Rhode Island, hoping to 
create a center to demonstrate a softer path of energy use.  By 1976, however, a lack of local 
funding and resistance to innovative ideas such as energy conservation and historic preservation led 
to the closing of RDI.  It was replaced by the for-profit REDE Corporation, which continued 
producing design proposals and projects until 1983.</p></bioghist>
