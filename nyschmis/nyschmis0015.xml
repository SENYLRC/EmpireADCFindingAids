            <p>Edward A. Smith joined the General Electric Research Laboratory in 1916. He rejoined the Laboratory following his enlistment in the U.S. Army for World War I, he rejoined the Research Lab and continued there until his retirement in 1961. Smith worked with Albert W. Hull on high power electronics, including the thyratron tube. Later in his career, he joined the Metal Studies Section of the Metallurgy and Ceramics Department where he researched Carboloy and Nickel-based metal alloys.</p>
