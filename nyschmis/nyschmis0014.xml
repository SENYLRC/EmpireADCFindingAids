            <p>William A. Rocco (1926-2011) graduated from SUNY Canton in 1947 and began a 39-year career at the GE Research and Development Center when he was hired by J. Herbert Hollomon to join the General Electric Research Laboratory’s new Metallurgy Department. Early in his career, Rocco’s projects included nucleation, dip forming of copper rods, and high temperature fuel cells. In 1960, Rocco joined GE’s diamond team, working with Drs. Robert Wentorf, Francis Bundy, and Hebert Strong to create gem diamonds and sintered diamond products. Rocco retired from GE in 1986.</p>
            <p>In 2000, Rocco helped organize the J. Herbert Hollomon reunion of the GE Research Center’s Metallurgy Department. Rocco developed binders with historical photographs and information about the Metallurgy Department, and maintained the records and correspondence for the reunion.</p>

        <scopecontent>
            <p>Papers primarily relate to William Rocco’s research on the development of Man-Made Diamonds. There is a small amount of information about Rocco’s fuel cell research and the development of microscopes at the GE Research &amp; Development Center.</p>
            <p>The papers also include correspondence and planning documents related to the J. Herbert Hollomon reunion, as well as historical items collected by Rocco for the reunion and video of the reunion itself.</p>
