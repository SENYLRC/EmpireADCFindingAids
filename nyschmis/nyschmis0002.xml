            <p>Willem Westendorp was born in Amsterdam, Holland and received his degree in electrical engineering from Delft Technical Institute in 1928.  He became an American citizen in 1934 and began to work for the General Electric Research and Development Center.  His work dealt with high voltages for x-rays, gas discharges, betatrons, synchrotrons and supercondoctor coils.  He retired in 1970, but continued to act as a consultant until 1980.  He died in 1989 at the age of 84.</p>
