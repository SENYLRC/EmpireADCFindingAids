            <p>John Hickey received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the College of the City of New York, N.Y., in 1942, and his M.S. degree in physics from Union College, Schenectady, N. Y., in 1951. In 1942 he joined General Electric as a member of the Electronics Laboratory and then as a member of the Research Laboratory.  He worked in the Laboratory until his retirement in 1984.</p>
