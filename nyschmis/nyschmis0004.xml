            <p>Through the 1940s and into the 1950s, General Electric undertook a research project to create synthetic diamonds.  Various forms of carbon were subjected to extreme heat and pressure in the hopes of fusing fusing carbon atoms into the crystalline structure of a diamond.  The exact moment of success is controversial, but on December 16, 1954, the engineer Tracy Hall produced the first verifiable synthetic diamond using reproducible means.</p>
            <p>General Electric maintained patents on the process, and created a line of industrial diamond products for sale fior such uses as cutting tools and abrasives.  They expanded into other super-hard crystals, such as the Borazon brand of  boron nitride crystals created by GE Chemist Robert Wentorf.</p>
            <p>During the early 1960s, General Electric fought a legal battle with the De Beers Diamond Company over the patent rights to the high temperature, high pressure method of making synthetic diamonds.  The battle was eventually settled with Da Beers agreeing to pay royalties to General Electirc.</p>

            <p>This collection was compiled by members of GE's Hall of Electric History and the Schenectady Museum during the late 90s and early 2000s.  It is mostly published materials, including articles, news clippings, press releases, publicity photographs and legal documents.  </p>

            <p>The researcher assumes full responsibility for conforming with the laws of copyright. Whenever possible, the miSci Archives will provide information about copyright owners and other restrictions, but the legal determination ultimately rests with the researcher.

                    <p>Most of the material collected by the staff of the Hall of History and miSci was placed in three-wing binders and organized by subject and type.  These materials are been placed in folders and labeled with the binder heading.  The materials include clippings, correspondence, press releases and photographs, all dealing with some aspect of GE's man made diamond products.</p>
