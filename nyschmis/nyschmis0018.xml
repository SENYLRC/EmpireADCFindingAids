            <p>Although Chester Rice (1888-1951) was the son of GE executive Edwin W. Rice, Jr., he became known in his own right as a researcher.  Some of the first radar tests in the world were conducted in Riceâ€™s home lab as he targeted trolleys passing by on Rugby Road.  When these tests proved successful, he installed his equipment at the Schenectady County Airport and tested it on passing aircraft.  Rice created several other inventions throughout his career, including a radio loudspeaker and a halogen leak detector for refrigerators.</p>

            <p>The Rice Papers contains the working papers of Chester Rice, including correspondence, notes, articles, patents, publications and photographs.  A small amount of the materials is biographical, and some appears to have been inserted into the collection by his family.  There is also a small amount of biographical material about his father, Edwin Rice.</p>
        <p>There is very little about his invention of the radio loudspeaker, but more about his other inventions.  Most of his professional correspondence was collected into letterbooks in chronological order, and this ordering has been maintained.  The collection has been organized alphabetically.</p>
